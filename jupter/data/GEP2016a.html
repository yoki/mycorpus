        <p>Global Outlook: Disappointments, Risks, and Spillovers. Global growth again fell short of expectations in 2015, decelerating to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent in 2014 (Chapter 1). The disappointing performance mainly reflected a continued growth deceleration in emerging and developing economies amid post-crisis lows in commodity prices, weaker capital flows and subdued global trade. Global growth is projected to edge up in the coming years, but at a slower pace than envisioned in June 2015, reaching 2.9 percent in 2016 and 3.1 percent in 2017-18. This pickup is predicated on continued gains in major high-income countries, a gradual tightening of financing conditions, a stabilization of commodity prices, and a gradual rebalancing in China. The forecast is subject to substantial downside risks, including a disorderly slowdown in major emerging market economies, financial market turmoil arising from sudden shifts in borrowing costs amid deteriorating fundamentals, lingering vulnerabilities in some countries, and heightened geopolitical tensions. Weakening growth and sharply lower commodity prices have narrowed the room for policy makers to respond, especially in commodity-exporting countries, should risks materialize. </p>
        <p>Who Catches a Cold When Emerging Markets Sneeze? Given the size and global economic integration of the largest emerging markets Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) the simultaneous slowdown underway in all but one of them could have significant spillovers to the rest of the world (Chapter 3). Specifically, a 1 percentage point decline in growth in BRICS is associated with a reduction in growth over the following two years by 0.8 percentage points in other emerging markets, 1.5 percentage points in frontier markets, and 0.4 percentage points in the global economy. Spillovers could be considerably larger if the growth slowdown in BRICS were combined with financial market turbulence. </p>
        <p>Within-Region Spillovers. Within-region spillovers from BRICS and other major emerging markets are discussed in Boxes 2.1-2.6 of Chapter 2. Since most BRICS are the largest and most integrated economies in their respective regions, they tend to generate larger spillovers than other major emerging markets. Strong within-region trade and remittance links are reflected in sizeable spillovers in Europe and Central Asia from a growth decline in Russia, and in East Asia and Pacific from a growth decline in China (Boxes 2.1 and 2.2). In other regions, measured within-region spillovers are typically small (Boxes 2.3-2.6), partly reflecting the lesser openness of major regional emerging markets or the prevalence of integration Global growth again fell short of expectations in 2015. Growth is projected to edge up in 2016-18 but the forecast is subject to substantial downside risks. In addition to discussing global and regional economic developments and outlook, this edition of the Global Economic Prospects also includes analysis of key challenges and opportunities currently confronting emerging and developing countries: spillovers from a slowdown in major emerging markets; the potential macroeconomic implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership; and the links between exchange rate regimes and capital controls in emerging and developing countries. It also includes a study on vulnerabilities accumulating between commodity discovery and production in low-income countries. </p>

        <p>with major advanced economies. Many emerging market and developing countries are still most susceptible to growth spillovers from major advanced markets. </p>
        <p>Potential Macroeconomic Implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. On October 4, 12 Pacific Rim countries concluded negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The first essay in Chapter 4 shows that, if ratified by all, the agreement could raise GDP in member countries by an average of 1.1 percent by 2030. It could also increase member countries trade by 11 percent by 2030. A common regulatory approach could buoy trade provided it is not associated with excessively restrictive requirements on rules of origin and standards. As long as regulatory reforms benefit non-members, the detrimental effects of the agreement due to trade diversion and preference erosion on non-members would be limited. </p>
        <p>Peg and Control? The Links between Exchange Rate Regimes and Capital Account Policies. As emerging and developing countries prepare to shield themselves from risks to the global outlook, they need to consider policy responses to adjust to external shocks. Among these, some countries might rely on exchange rate flexibility as a buffer, some might aim to minimize currency fluctuations, and some might consider measures to limit capital flows as they seek to keep some degree of monetary policy control. The second essay in Chapter 4 explores how emerging markets and developing countries manage these competing pressures. The results suggest that developing countries with fixed exchange rate regimes appear to be more likely to have capital flow restrictions. This effect is particularly pronounced for lowerincome countries. </p>
        <p>From Commodity Discovery to Production: </p>
        <p>Vulnerabilities and Policies in Low-Income Countries. Major natural resource discoveries have transformed growth prospects for many lowincome countries (LICs), though the sharp postcrisis downturn in commodity prices may delay development of these discoveries into production. During the pre-production period, macroeconomic vulnerabilities in these economies may rise as a result of large-scale investment needs. This heightens the importance of reducing lead times between discovery and production. The Special Focus finds that such lead times can be shortened by several years through improvements in business environments that benefit resource and non-resource sectors alike. Separately, while growth in LICs eased in 2015, it continued to be robust at about 5 percent, sustained by investment (both public and private, including in mining) and rising farm output. For 2016-17, strengthening import demand in advanced economies should help support activity in these countries. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf1b" class="" data-page-no="1b">
        <p>A further deceleration of activity in key emerging and developing economies overshadowed a modest recovery in major high-income countries in 2015. This deceleration was accompanied by further declines in commodity prices, subdued global trade, bouts of financial market volatility, and weakening capital flows. Global growth continued to disappoint, and is now estimated at a slowerthan-expected 2.4 percent in 2015, 0.4 percentage point below June 2015 Global Economic </p>
        <p>Prospects projections. </p>
        <p>In developing countries, growth in 2015 is estimated at a post-crisis low of 4.3 percent, down from 4.9 percent in 2014 and 0.4 percentage point lower than projected in June (Figure 1.1). In a development unprecedented since the 1980s, most of the largest emerging economies in each region have been slowing simultaneously for three consecutive years. The economic rebalancing in China is continuing and accompanied by slowing growth. Brazil and Russia have been going through severe adjustments in the face of external and domestic challenges. On average, activity in emerging and developing commodity exporters stagnated in 2015, as they continued to be hard hit by declining commodity prices. As a result, the contribution to global growth from these economies has declined substantially. More generally, 2015 growth estimates for more than half of developing countries were further downgraded. Disappointments are concentrated in Latin America and, to a lesser degree, Sub-Saharan Africa, where a number of commodity exporters are struggling to maintain growth. </p>
        <p>Global growth again fell short of expectations in 2015, slowing to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent in 2014. The disappointing performance was mainly due to a continued deceleration of economic activity in emerging and developing economies amid weakening commodity prices, global trade, and capital flows. Going forward, global growth is projected to edge up, but at a slower pace than envisioned in the June 2015 forecast, reaching 2.9 percent in 2016 and 3.1 percent in 2017-18. The forecast is subject to substantial downside risks, including a sharper-than-expected slowdown in major emerging and developing economies or financial market turmoil arising from a sudden increase in borrowing costs that could combine with deteriorating fundamentals and lingering vulnerabilities in some countries. Notable exceptions in an otherwise gloomy outlook for developing countries include South Asia (reflecting reduced macroeconomic vulnerabilities and domestic policy reforms in India), as well as some commodity-importing countries in East Asia. Growth in low-income countries generally remained robust in 2015, albeit slowing to 5.1 percent from 6.1 percent in 2014. Some low-income economies showed continued strength (Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania), supported by largescale infrastructure investment, ongoing mine development, and consumer spending. However, fiscal risks have increased in several countries in East Africa because of sharp increases in public debt and contingent liabilities. </p>
        <p>These scattered bright spots aside, the widespread slowdown across emerging and developing economies is a source of concern for the global economy and poses a threat to hard-won achievements in poverty reduction: more than 40 percent of the world s poor live in the developing countries where growth slowed in 2015. </p>
        <p>Worsening prospects for developing countries have coincided with a sharp slowdown in global trade, a rise in financial market volatility, and a substantial decrease in capital inflows (Figure 1.2). In anticipation of tighter U.S. monetary policy, currency pressures have intensified and borrowing costs have increased, particularly for a number of commodity exporters. Significant nominal currency depreciations against the U.S. dollar are straining balance sheets in countries with elevated dollar-denominated liabilities. In an environment of weak global trade, exports are likely to languish. On the domestic front, a trend deceleration in productivity growth, rising private sector leverage, depleted fiscal buffers, and heightened policy uncertainty are major headwinds. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf1d" class="" data-page-no="1d">
        <p>In contrast to developing countries, the recovery in major high-income countries gained traction in 2015 and has been increasingly driven by stronger domestic demand as labor markets heal and credit conditions improve. However, 2016 growth forecasts for high-income countries have been marked down in light of the effect on the United States of dollar appreciation and the impact on Japan of slowing trade in Asia. Conditions for a continued but fragile upturn in the Euro Area still appear in place, despite soft external demand and rising geopolitical concerns. Albeit gradually dissipating, legacies from the global financial crisis continue to be felt across high-income countries, limiting both aggregate demand and the underlying growth potential of these economies. Going forward, global growth should pick up, albeit at an appreciably slower pace than previously projected, reaching 2.9 percent in 2016 and 3.1 percent in 2017-18. Global inflation is expected to increase moderately in 2016 as commodity prices level off, but will remain low by historical standards. A modest upturn in global activity in 2016 and beyond is predicated on a continued recovery in major high-income countries, a gradual slowdown and rebalancing in China, a stabilization of commodity prices, and an increase in global interest rates that is gradual and stays well contained. All of these projections, however, are subject to substantial downside risks. Although it is still a low-probability scenario, a faster-than-expected slowdown in China combined with a more protracted deceleration in other large emerging markets is a risk. Empirical estimates suggest that a sustained 1 percentage point decline in growth in the BRICS (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa) would reduce growth in other emerging and developing economies by around 0.8 percentage point and global growth by 0.4 percentage point. This suggests a substantial risk of contagion through other emerging markets, with potential adverse effects for some advanced economies as well. Compounding this risk is the possibility of a protracted decline in potential growth throughout emerging and developing economies, persistently subdued growth in major high-income countries, and an escalation of </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf1e" class="" data-page-no="1e">
        <p>geopolitical tensions. In addition, baseline forecasts of a smooth monetary policy tightening cycle in the United States are subject to considerable uncertainty. A sudden readjustment of expectations about the future trajectory of U.S. interest rates could combine with domestic fragilities and policy uncertainties in some developing countries to generate financial stress. Given the weak outlook and lingering vulnerabilities in many developing countries, these risks have the potential to be a source of damaging sudden stops in capital flows in the most fragile economies. </p>
        <p>Policies can play an important role in mitigating risks and supporting growth. A combination of cyclical and structural policies could be mutually reinforcing. In the near term, policy actions need to be focused on building the ability to withstand financial market turbulence. Cyclical policies need to be supplemented with structural reform measures that boost investors confidence in the short term and enhance growth prospects in the long term. </p>
        <p>The recovery in major high-income countries gained traction last year. This has been increasingly driven by stronger domestic demand, particularly in the United States, where employment conditions are robust. In the Euro Area, credit growth is picking up and unemployment is declining. The recovery remains fragile in Japan despite substantial policy stimulus. With external demand negatively affected by a slowdown in large emerging market economies, growth forecasts across major high-income economies in 2016 have been shaded down, but growth should still show some improvement from 2015. The tightening cycle of the U.S. Federal Reserve is projected to be very gradual, while policy accommodation will likely continue in the Euro Area and Japan. China s gradual slowdown and rebalancing continued in 2015, as further deceleration in sectors with excess capacity was partially offset by robust growth in services. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf1f" class="" data-page-no="1f">
        <p>United States </p>
        <p>Domestic demand in 2015 was supported by robust consumption and dynamic investment outside the oil sector. In contrast, net exports remained a drag on growth and industrial activity continued to be subdued in the second half of 2015 (Figure 1.3). For 2015 as a whole, growth is estimated at 2.5 percent the highest annual rate in the post-crisis period. Solid labor market conditions continued to support a consumptionled recovery, with job creation averaging more than 200,000 per month in 2015 and the unemployment rate falling to 5 percent in the final quarter of 2015. However, labor participation has continued to trend down, and is unlikely to recover much as the number of babyboomers approaching retirement age increases. Labor productivity has moved downward in recent years, constraining potential output growth (Gordon 2014, Hall 2014, Fernald and Wang 2015). Household real disposable income has been boosted by employment gains, declining oil prices and moderate wage growth. This led to rising personal consumption growth in 2015, despite an increase in the savings ratio. A recovery in housing markets and prospects of strengthening wage growth amid tight labor market conditions support a positive outlook in 2016. </p>
        <p>The decline in net exports is a principal factor dampening growth at present. This is the result of the strength of the dollar and the softness in external demand, particularly from large emerging markets. Reflecting in part asynchronous monetary policy stances among major central banks, the dollar has appreciated more than 20 percent in nominal effective terms and 18 percent in real effective terms since mid-2014. Empirical studies suggest that an appreciation around this size may reduce GDP growth by one percentage point after two years (Laporte and Roberts 2014; Brayton, Laubach, and </p>
        <p>Reifschneider 2014). </p>
        <p>Headline inflation continued to hover around zero in the second half of 2015, with the renewed fall in oil prices during the summer of 2015 and the strengthening dollar exerting downward pressures. Excluding food and energy, inflation stayed below 2 percent and is projected to rise only gradually in </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf20" class="" data-page-no="20">
        <p>further to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015, the result of stronger growth and consolidation efforts. Fiscal policy has eased to a broadly growth-neutral stance in 2014-15, having weighed on activity in previous years. </p>
        <p>Robust employment growth, still-accommodative financing conditions, and low oil prices should continue to support domestic demand in the period ahead. Growth is projected to average 2.7 percent in 2016, above potential but somewhat lower than predicted in June, reflecting a larger drag from net exports. Growth is expected to stabilize around 2.3 percent in 2017-18, with the output gap closing in 2017. Monetary policy tightening is likely to be very gradual throughout the forecast period. </p>
        <p>Euro Area </p>
        <p>Growth picked up in 2015, as domestic demand strengthened and exports accelerated, partly due to the lagged effect of a euro depreciation (Figure 1.4). For the year as a whole, Euro Area growth is estimated at 1.5 percent, in line with previous expectations, with activity firming in Spain, somewhat disappointing in Germany, and still lagging (albeit gradually recovering) in France and Italy. Low oil prices and favorable financing conditions are supporting consumer spending and investment. In the absence of further escalation, security concerns following the terrorist attacks in Paris are not expected to have lasting effects on confidence and activity. </p>
        <p>Diminishing fiscal consolidation and healing labor markets are underpinning domestic demand, although conditions vary across countries. Since the start of the European Central Bank s (ECB) quantitative easing program, credit conditions have improved and credit growth has resumed following several years of contraction. However, credit remains tight in some countries because of elevated non-performing loans and impaired bank balance sheets. Despite the monetary policy easing, the euro appreciated about 7 percent in trade-weighted terms since reaching a low in April 2015, mainly reflecting the broad-based depreciation of emerging-market currencies. This may reduce somewhat the momentum of export growth and delay a pick-up in inflation. Although 2016. Market-based inflation expectations remained somewhat below the Federal Reserve s 2 percent inflation target in the second half of 2015, pointing towards a gradual normalization of policy rates. The fiscal deficit is estimated to have fallen </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf21" class="" data-page-no="21">
        <p>the impact may vary depending on the underlying factors driving currency movements, results from a number of macroeconomic models indicate that a 7 percent euro appreciation reduces Euro Area GDP growth by between 0.2-0.4 percentage point, and inflation by 0.1-0.5 percentage point (ECB 2015a, European Commission 2015a). </p>
        <p>Peripheral economies have been little affected by contagion from the Greece crisis. A third bailout program was agreed to with European partners in August 2015, amounting to 86 billion ($95 billion), in exchange for pension, tax, and other reforms. The weakening of the Greek economy following the implementation of capital controls in June 2015 will make program implementation challenging, but the disbursement of bailout funds and the agreed bank recapitalization plan have reduced immediate funding pressures. </p>
        <p>Deflation concerns have receded since the start of 2015 but have not disappeared, with core inflation and wage growth remaining subdued, particularly among economies with high long-term unemployment rates. Headline inflation remained close to zero in 2015. Market-based inflation expectations have bottomed out but remain below the 2 percent target. This situation led the ECB to ease monetary policy further in December 2015. Conditions should continue to improve in 2016, with growth reaching 1.7 percent, a bit slower than expected in June, reflecting a weakening external environment. Growth should average 1.6 percent in 2017-18, slightly above potential. However, concerns persist about low potential growth, high unemployment, and large public debt. While population ageing limits growth potential (Jimeno 2015), labor mobility and migration can help alleviate some of these constraints (World Bank 2015b) and help adjustments to country-specific shocks in monetary union (Beyer and Smets 2015). </p>
        <p>The recent acceleration in the number of asylum seekers is creating important absorption and policy challenges that could strain public services and government finances in exposed countries, but is expected to provide some marginal support to Euro Area-wide growth in the short-term through rising public expenditure and private consumption.1 Over the medium term, the influx may also help to meet labor shortages in the face of an ageing population. However, the ultimate effect on growth and public finances remains highly uncertain, depending on the performance of migrants in the labor market (Münz et al. 2006, OECD 2014) as well as the coherence of national and EU policy responses. </p>
        <p>Japan </p>
        <p>Japan experienced a soft growth patch in mid2015, confirming a weak underlying trend despite rising corporate profits and continued policy stimulus. Private consumption contracted in 2015 and investment was stagnant, which was only partially offset by positive but relatively subdued export growth (Figure 1.5). Overall, GDP growth is estimated at 0.8 percent for 2015, 0.3 percentage point lower than projected in June. Despite the low value of the yen since 2013, the export response has been modest. This disappointment partly owes to past offshoring of production to the rest of Asia, which helped develop regional value chains and shifted sales to overseas subsidiaries. The transition to foreign plants was led by the more productive enterprises (Wakasugi et al. 2014). This offshoring trend appears to have lowered Japan s gross export elasticity. Weakening external demand from the rest of Asia also played a dampening role on exports, as value-added trade between Japan and other Asian countries intensified during the 2000s (Ito and Wakasugi 2015). </p>
        <p>The Bank of Japan maintained its commitment to quantitative easing, and a further expansion of asset purchases is likely as inflation is not expected to reach the central bank s target before 2017. Tax revenues have increased following the rise in the consumption tax in April 2014 and the growth in corporate profits, but achieving primary balance by 2020-21 will be challenging, as spending pressures on social security and defense remain significant. Skill shortages in key services sectors </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf22" class="" data-page-no="22">
        <p>Sustained policy accommodation, and the prospect of higher earnings and record low unemployment, are positives for the outlook. Going forward, growth is expected to recover to 1.3 percent in 2016, less than expected in June due to a downward revision to both domestic demand and exports. The recovery remains fragile and dominated by downside risks. </p>
        <p>China </p>
        <p>Sectoral rebalancing in China became more pronounced in 2015. It was accompanied by bouts of volatility in financial markets and additional government stimulus measures. Growth in 2015 is estimated at 6.9 percent, down from 7.3 percent the previous year. The deceleration reflects an ongoing correction in the property sector, weakness in industrial activity, and slower growth in non-traditional credit. The robust expansion of consumer spending and services has helped boost the economy, and is in line with the rebalancing sought by policymakers. Even so, forecasts for 2016-17 have been downgraded, with growth expected to reach 6.5 percent by 2017. </p>
        <p>In line with rebalancing efforts, the deceleration in activity during 2015 has been most visible in industry and real estate sectors with considerable overcapacity and, in the case of industry, a high presence of state-owned enterprises (Figure 1.6). These sectors saw the sharpest increase in investment and leverage in 2009-13, resulting in a significant concentration of debt among a small number of large firms (Chivakul and Lam 2015). Balance sheets and credit quality have deteriorated in sectors with excess capacity. Policy efforts to reduce supply mismatches in the real estate sector, and to tighten nonbank credit flows, continued to weigh on non-traditional credit growth, which slowed notably during 2015. Weaker activity in manufacturing and construction have significantly impacted import demand, which contracted in the first half of 2015. </p>
        <p>The service sector has seen its share of employment increasing in recent years, and accounted for the majority of new urban jobs created in 2015 (World Bank 2015a). This helped offset stagnant hiring in shrinking industrial sectors, and kept urban labor markets tight. Wages continued to increase, as reforms that have encouraged female labor force participation have only partially offset demographic pressures on labor supply. The tight labor market in the services sector raises the prospect of a gradual acceleration in wage growth. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf23" class="" data-page-no="23">
        <p>and real incomes have continued to increase, albeit at lower rates, contributing to sustained growth of private consumption. A continued rebalancing from industry to services should support the shift from investment to consumption, whose share in GDP is gradually recovering from a post-crisis dip. Policies became more supportive throughout the course of 2015, in order to counter slowing activity. The People s Bank of China (PBOC) continued to lower benchmark interest rates and required reserve ratios, while implementing new collateral policies to facilitate refinancing for commercial banks. The central bank also continued to inject liquidity into the financial system, especially during the June stock market correction. The fiscal deficit widened to a six-year high of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting accelerated infrastructure investment by the central government in the second half of the year. The increase in central government spending more than offset cutbacks at the local government level resulting from lower revenues due to falling land sales, restrictions imposed on borrowing through Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFV), and other off-budget transactions. </p>
        <p>To foster greater exchange rate flexibility, the PBOC introduced a change in the calculation of the renminbi reference rate on August 10. This led to an almost 3 percent depreciation against the U.S. dollar, the largest three-day drop since the mid-1990s. The change was implemented against a backdrop of accelerated capital outflows and slowing growth. While it sparked some market volatility in the short term, the decision was fully aligned with the objective of allowing market forces to play a greater role in the economy. With this exception, the renminbi has been stable throughout 2015, and has continued to appreciate in real effective terms despite strong capital outflows. </p>
        <p>Private capital outflows have increased as capital controls have been loosened. The net outflow reflects corporate efforts to reduce net foreign currency exposures and foreign short-term debt. Currency interventions to reduce the resulting downward pressure on the renminbi contributed to an estimated US$443 billion decline in foreign currency reserves since September 2014 (11.5 percent off their peak level). The drop in reserves in August 2015, US$94 billion, was the sharpest drop on record, and partly reflected valuation effects, as well as an effort to diversify foreign </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf24" class="" data-page-no="24">
        <p>assets through the purchase of gold. </p>
        <p>Notwithstanding this decline, China s foreign exchange reserves remain substantial, at about US$3.5 trillion (or 32.8 percent of GDP). </p>
        <p>Concerns about the growth outlook and prospects of rising U.S. interest rates led to a tightening in financing conditions for many developing countries and contributed to a significant slowdown in capital inflows in 2015. Commodity exporters, and countries with heightened domestic challenges, are especially affected. The widespread slowdown in emerging market economies contributed to a contraction in global trade in the first half of the year, adding headwinds to the global recovery. The broad weakness in commodity prices in 2015 is expected to persist in 2016, maintaining pressure on commodity exporters while supporting real income gains among importers. </p>
        <p>Increasingly difficult financial conditions Global financial market volatility rose noticeably in 2015 against the backdrop of slowing activity in large emerging economies, diverging monetary policies of major central banks, continued declines in commodity prices, and fragile liquidity conditions. In this context, market adjustments to adverse or unexpected news have been abrupt. Following a correction from overvalued equity prices in China and an unforeseen change in its exchange rate regime during the summer of 2015, the VIX index of stock-market volatility, often considered a proxy of global risk aversion, briefly surged to levels last seen during the 2011-12 Euro Area crisis (Figure 1.7)2. While there was no unusual stress in short-term funding markets, nor a credit crunch in any large emerging markets, the summer market turmoil led to a sharp sell-off in developing country assets and a drop in capital inflows to those economies. </p>
        <p>Half of the 20 largest developing-country stock markets saw plunges of 20 percent or more from their 2015 peaks. Currencies of key commodity exporters (including Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, and South Africa), and developing countries subject to heightened political risk (including Brazil and Turkey) fell to multi-year lows both against the U.S. dollar as </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf25" class="" data-page-no="25">
        <p>well as in trade-weighted terms (Figure 1.7). Since July 2015, sovereign debt spreads have widened by 45 basis points and emerging market corporate debt spreads by 80 basis points, with the largest increases occurring among commodity exporters in Africa, Latin America, and East Asia. Since October, equity markets have rebounded, and sovereign bond spreads have narrowed, although remaining elevated in many countries. Several emerging market currencies also retraced some of their losses against the U.S. dollar, led by the Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah. Global investors pulled about $52 billion from emerging market equity and bond funds in the third quarter of 2015, the largest quarterly outflow on record (Figure 1.8). This was mostly driven by institutional investors reducing their exposure in a sign of deteriorating confidence about long-term prospects. Net short-term debt and bank outflows from China, combined with a broad-based retrenchment in the Russian Federation, accounted for the bulk of the outflow from emerging markets, but portfolio and short-term capital inflows also dried up elsewhere in the third quarter of 2015. Meanwhile, FDI inflows remained generally steady, although they decelerated in some economies. </p>
        <p>International bond issuance by emerging market corporates slowed significantly, particularly in the oil and gas sector. This has partially reversed the post-crisis doubling of bond issuance by developing country corporates, especially in commodities-related sectors. Since 2010, bonds have been issued more often to refinance debt than for investment purposes (Rodrigues Bastos, Kamil, and Sutton 2015). In consequence, some commodity firms have become highly leveraged, and are now vulnerable to a combination of rising borrowing costs and declining commodity prices. Looking ahead, the diverging monetary policy stances of major economies will continue to be a key determinant of financial conditions in developing countries. </p>
        <p> United States.</p>
        <p>Following a first hike in </p>
        <p>December 2015, the pace of interest rate increases in the United States is expected to be gradual and notably slower than in previous tightening cycles, reflecting in part low inflation expectations and U.S. dollar appreciation. Legacies from the crisis, such as elevated household debt and weak productivity growth, also point towards a protracted period of low interest rates. Since the tightening cycle has been widely anticipated, baseline projections assume a benign impact on capital inflows to emerging and developing economies. However, as financial market expectations are susceptible to scares, risks of volatility during the Fed tightening cycle remain significant (Arteta et al. 2015). </p>

        <p>dropped below $40 per barrel towards the end of 2015. Prices have been driven lower by high stocks in OECD economies, ample global supplies, and expectations of slower global demand (particularly from large emerging markets). U.S. crude oil production has begun to decline due to lower investment and drilling but was resilient for most of 2015. OPEC production increased further, reaching a three year high, with much of the increase coming from Saudi Arabia and Iraq. A removal of sanctions following the implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement could increase Iranian oil exports by 0.5-0.7 million barrels per day by 2016, nearing the pre-sanctions level of 4 percent of global consumption. Since other energy prices are at least partially linked to oil prices, prices for other energy products, including natural gas, have also fallen. </p>
        <p> Metals. The slump in metal prices, which reached their lowest levels in more than 6 years in November, reflects well-supplied markets as well as weaker growth in major emerging markets. New mining capacity came into operation in several countries, especially Australia, adding to already abundant supplies. </p>
        <p> Agricultural commodities. Grain and oilseed prices dipped in 2015, mostly in response to well-supplied markets, with the agricultural price index standing 33 percent below its early-2011 high as of November. The stocks-to-use ratio (a measure of how well supplied markets are) for key grains remains well above its 5- and 10-year average levels. Ample supplies and the weak influence of global food prices on most local prices, suggest that the El Niño weather pattern, which some forecasts say may be the strongest since 1997-98, is unlikely to raise global food commodity prices in a significant way (World Bank 2015c). </p>
        <p>Conditions remain in place for a protracted period of low commodity prices in coming years. Oil prices are projected to average $49 per barrel in 2016, and then rise only gradually. Metal and agricultural prices are likely to edge up in the range of 1-2 percent. While geopolitical risks and Euro Area and Japan. Continued quantitative easing by the ECB and the Bank of Japan should help shore up global liquidity. </p>
        <p>Negative interest rates in Europe and increasing yield differentials with the United States could contribute to a further appreciation of the U.S. dollar and have mixed effects for developing countries. On the one hand, the increase in cross-border lending from European banks and Eurobond issuance during 2015 is likely to continue as the Euro Area recovery becomes more firmly entrenched and as bank balance sheets improve. On the other hand, continued strengthening of the dollar could contribute to refinancing pressures in countries with significant dollar-denominated liabilities. Capital inflows to developing countries dipped to a post-crisis low relative to GDP in 2015 (Table 1.1). They are expected to recover slowly in 201617 as developing-country growth stabilizes. A gradual shift from portfolio to cross-border bank lending flows is likely to continue, supported in particular by a healing European banking sector and ongoing policy accommodation by the ECB. A gradual rise in global interest rates and continued weakness in commodity prices could affect FDI decisions, particularly in mining and exploration, while the cost of infrastructure financing is expected to rise. Renewed bouts of volatility, or heightened concerns about developing country growth prospects, represent downside risks to this benign scenario. </p>
        <p>Renewed decline in commodity prices </p>
        <p>Commodity prices fell further in the second half of 2015. By November, the three industrial commodity price indexes energy, metals, and agricultural raw materials were down, on average, 45 percent from their 2011 peaks (Figure 1.9). Abundant supplies, due in part to investment during the decade-long price boom, and softening demand are the main factors behind the continued weakness. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the currency in which most commodities are traded, has also contributed to the price weakness. Oil.

        <p>adverse weather conditions could lead to a more rapid recovery in prices, risks are on the downside. In the case of oil, prices may come under renewed downward pressure if weakness in emerging and developing economies persists or if the Islamic Republic of Iran receives substantial foreign investment to expand capacity quickly (Iran has the world s largest proven natural gas reserves, and fourth largest oil reserves). These developments suggest continued significant headwinds for the outlook for growth, fiscal positions, and trade of commodity-exporting countries, emphasizing the need to accelerate the diversification of their economies. </p>
        <p>Global trade weakness </p>
        <p>Global merchandise trade contracted in the first half of 2015, for the first time since 2009 (Figure 1.10). This was largely driven by a drop in import demand from emerging and developing economies, including in East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Growing import demand from the United States and the Euro Area did not offset the drop in developing countries import demand, which now accounts for half of global trade. The contraction in import demand from emerging and developing economies reflected four trends: GDP contractions in Brazil and the Russian Federation. Recessions in these two countries sharply reduced import demand. Sanctions against the Russian Federation further restricted trade. More generally, sharp declines in commodity prices reduced export revenues and demand across commodity exporters, leading to a significant slowdown in imports from these countries. </p>
        <p> Rebalancing in China. As a result of an increasingly pronounced shift in sources of growth from trade-intensive investment and exports toward less trade-intensive consumption and services, import growth has slowed. </p>
        <p> Currency depreciations. Real effective exchange rate depreciations have been accompanied by a decline in imports in several countries, but have thus far shown limited benefits for exports. This may partly reflect changes in global value chains that may be reducing the elasticity of exports to real effective appreciation (Ahmed, Appendino, and Ruta 2015). </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf28" class="" data-page-no="28">
        <p>However, conventional trade, which still represents roughly half of global trade flows, shows greater responsiveness to exchange rate developments (IMF 2015a). </p>
        <p> Stabilization of value chains. During 19902008, countries that were integrating faster into global value chains also saw more rapid export growth than others (Escaith and </p>
        <p>Miroudot 2015). Since then, value chains appear to have stabilized such that manufacturing sub-sectors with a higher degree of vertical specialization witnessed the largest deceleration in trade growth </p>
        <p>(Constantinescu, Mattoo, and Ruta 2015, </p>
        <p>World Bank 2015d). </p>
        <p>Estimates for trade flows in 2015 and forecasts for 2016-17 have been revised down, in line with the weakened post-crisis relationship between trade and activity.3 Persistent weakness in global trade diminishes export opportunities but also the scope for productivity gains through increasing specialization and diffusion of technologies. This could continue to put a cap on growth prospects, particularly among smaller and more open developing economies. Renewed liberalization efforts could help reinvigorate trade.4 The TransPacific Partnership (TPP), agreed at the technical level between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam, could provide a new impetus to trade, and lift activity, by helping to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers (Chapter 4). By 2030, the TPP could lift member country GDP by an average of 1.1 percent, with much larger benefits in countries with currently high trade barriers like Vietnam and Malaysia. The spillover effects for nonmembers remain uncertain. Losses due to preference erosion and trade diversion could be partially offset by positive spillovers from regulatory convergence. </p>

        <p>Growth in developing countries slowed to 4.3 percent in 2015, reflecting domestic and external challenges. Domestic difficulties included slowing productivity growth, policy uncertainty, and eroding policy buffers that have led to contractionary monetary and fiscal policies in some countries. External headwinds include persistently low commodity prices, subdued global trade, spillovers from weakness in major emerging markets, decelerating capital flows and rising borrowing costs. The slowdown reflects both cyclical and structural components. Commodity exporters have continued to adjust to steep declines in oil and other commodity prices. In low-income countries, however, growth has remained robust, as solid infrastructure investment and consumer spending has partly offset weakening external demand. The modest pickup in activity in developing countries expected in 2016 and 2017 is predicated on continued growth momentum in high-income countries, stabilization of commodity prices, stillaccommodative monetary policy in major economies, and a steady process of rebalancing in China. Recent developments </p>
        <p>Developing-country growth slowed in 2015 to 4.3 percent, its weakest showing since 2009, and a pace well below its pre-crisis average (Figure 1.11). China s economy continued to slow in an orderly fashion, and its rebalancing away from import and commodity-intensive activities has had repercussions for global trade and commodity prices. Brazil and the Russian Federation have taken a turn for the worse as a result of global and domestic headwinds, with both countries experiencing deepening contractions, above-target inflation, and deteriorating public finances. In South Africa, chronic power supply bottlenecks are a major factor behind weak growth. In contrast to other major developing countries, growth in India remained robust, buoyed by strong investor sentiment and the positive effect on real incomes of the recent fall in oil prices. </p>
        <p>The fact that four of the five BRICS are experiencing slowing or contracting activity, as are a substantial fraction of other developing countries, highlights the synchronous nature of the ongoing deceleration in developing countries more so than in any episode over the past 25 years, with the exception of the Great Recession of 2009.5 </p>
        <p>In about half of developing countries, growth in 2015 is likely to fall short of expectations, with the largest disappointments among energy exporters (Angola, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, </p>
        <p>Nigeria, the Russian Federation, the República Bolivariana de Venezuela) and countries experiencing conflicts (Ukraine) or policy </p>

        <p>uncertainty (Brazil). In contrast, the continued recovery in the Euro Area has lifted growth more than expected in some of its developing country trading partners, including those in Europe and Central Asia and North Africa. </p>
        <p>Both external factors including weak global trade, financial market volatility, and persistently low commodity prices and domestic factors have contributed to the slowdown. Adverse external developments have continued to hit commodityexporting developing economies particularly hard. Growth in several of the largest ones (Brazil, Colombia, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa) weakened considerably in 2015, as the impact of deteriorating terms of trade on exports was compounded by tightening macroeconomic policy and softening investor confidence. Governments responded to falling fiscal revenues from the resource sector with spending cuts. Central banks raised interest rates to help moderate pressures on exchange or inflation rates. Investor confidence weakened on deteriorating growth prospects and credit ratings, resulting in declining capital inflows and currency depreciations. </p>
        <p>The recent slowdown in developing-country growth partly reflects an unwinding of cyclically strong, policy-supported, post-crisis growth, especially in East Asia and Pacific and in Latin America and the Caribbean. However, it also has a considerable structural component, which is most pronounced in Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa. On average, among the 24 largest emerging and developing economies, about one-third of the slowdown between 2010 and 2014 was structural in nature (Didier et al. 2015). In particular, demographic trends have passed a turning point since the global crisis with potentially profound implications for growth (World Bank 2015b). Since 2010, working-age population growth has slowed, particularly in Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa. As a result, the share of the working-age population has risen only marginally or fallen in most regions other than Sub-Saharan Africa, where many countries are still in a phase of pre- or early demographic dividends. Other domestic sources of the slowdown include slowing productivity growth, continued domestic policy uncertainty, and as discussed in detail later eroding policy buffers that narrowed policy options. </p>
        <p> Slowing productivity growth. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth in emerging markets has declined steadily since 2010. By 2014, TFP growth had returned to its longterm average of around 0.5 percent, well below the 2.3 percent gain recorded in 2010 (Didier et al. 2015). The TFP slowdown was pronounced in the Middle East and North Africa, where TFP has been contracting since 2007. In Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia TFP growth has ground to a virtual halt. </p>
        <p> Policy uncertainty. Domestic policy uncertainty increased in 2015 (including in Latin </p>
        <p>America, East Asia and the Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia), as a result of elections, or political unrest. Among lowincome countries, a flare-up of violence (Afghanistan), political tensions (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Guinea Bissau, Nepal), and uncertainty surrounding elections and labor disputes (Benin, Democratic Republic of </p>
        <p>Congo) drove up political risk in 2015. Concerns about policy direction can hold back domestic and foreign investors, reduce capital flows and dampen investment and consumption growth (Gourio, Siemer, and </p>
        <p>Verdelhan 2014; Julio and Yook 2013). </p>
        <p>Policy uncertainty and the removal of policy stimulus have weighed on investment and consumption growth rates, which have fallen well below pre-crisis levels. Growth of credit to the private sector has slowed sharply in several countries (Figure 1.12). In some places, credit retrenchment reflects monetary policy tightening to mitigate inflation concerns (Brazil, South Africa) and slowing capital inflows, weighing further on domestic liquidity and credit conditions. Other reasons behind the slowdown in credit growth include weak domestic demand, heightened uncertainty, and the government s decision to reduce the use of public credit as a </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf2b" class="" data-page-no="2b">
        <p>counter-cyclical tool. In several countries, consumption growth has been further dampened by rising unemployment rates (including Brazil and South Africa), and moderating employment growth. </p>
        <p>Partly reflecting uncertainty about the outlook, consumption growth remains below its pre-crisis and long-term averages, despite increased real incomes due to declines in food inflation and oil prices. In several countries, these developments have sharply reduced headline inflation, especially in countries with a large share of food in their consumption baskets (India, Pakistan, the Philippines). In some regions and countries (Europe and Central Asia, Thailand), falling food and oil prices have coincided with persistent economic slack and played a role in lowering inflation below target rates. </p>
        <p>Low-income countries have generally remained resilient, growing by 5.1 percent in 2015. Largescale infrastructure investment and sustained consumer spending helped offset weakening external demand and low commodity prices. Even so, commodity-exporting low-income countries faced currency pressures, which contributed to a sharp increase in interest rates in Uganda and a decline in reserves in many countries (Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zimbabwe). </p>
        <p>Eroding buffers and lingering vulnerabilities </p>
        <p>Weakening activity in developing countries has been accompanied by eroding policy space and lingering vulnerabilities (Figure 1.13). Slowing growth, rising debt, and, for commodity exporters, weakening export and fiscal revenues, have eroded credit ratings. Some large emerging and developing economies lost, or risked losing, investment grade status in 2015 (Brazil, the Russian Federation), and some others appeared to be struggling to maintain it. </p>
        <p>Eroding policy space. As growth has slowed and as authorities have supported economic activity with fiscal stimulus and monetary policy loosening, policy buffers have eroded. Fiscal deficits have widened from pre-crisis levels in commodity exporters and importers alike (World Bank 2015d,e). Inflation, especially in commodity exporters, has risen outside target bands and external and foreign currency debt has increased. With shrinking policy room, domestic policy stimulus has been gradually withdrawn. </p>

      <div id="pf2c" class="" data-page-no="2c">
        <p>construction and mining, and among firms with weakening balance sheets (IMF 2015b). Corporate debt has been increasingly financed through international bond issuance rather than bank lending. In some cases this has meant rising currency exposures, with debt service costs more sensitive to changing global financing conditions. Past experience suggests that rising corporate leverage increases the probability of capital flow reversals (Mendoza 2010; Mendoza and Terrones 2008; Elekdag and Wu 2011). Finally, many developing-country banking sectors with high non-performing loan ratios have not seen much improvement in asset quality. </p>
        <p>Large external debt. Some developing countries with elevated total external debt, or with a high share of short-term external debt, have made little progress in reducing such burdens (the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, South Africa, Turkey). India, Mexico, and South Africa have reduced the share of their external debt denominated in foreign currency but still carry sizable stocks. As monetary policy tightens in the United States, some of these countries may be vulnerable to rollover, exchange rate, and interest rate risks (Borio 2014, IMF 2015b). Foreign reserves have come under pressure in many commodity exporters (Indonesia, Malaysia), and in countries which are prone to capital flow reversals (Turkey). Current account balances have improved among a number of oil-importing economies, although deficits remain elevated for several of them. </p>
        <p>Deteriorating public sector balance sheets. General government debt has increased in many developing countries. Fiscal deficits have deteriorated considerably more than expected in commodity exporters, while remaining broadly steady in other developing countries. As a result, the number of countries in which debt is rising has surged from pre-crisis levels. In a number of developing countries (Indonesia, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Turkey), foreign participation in government debt markets remains elevated, making them potentially vulnerable to global shifts in investor sentiment (Arslanalp and Tsuda 2014). </p>
        <p>Weakening corporate balance sheets. Corporate leverage has grown significantly since 2009. It has become increasingly concentrated in sectors more exposed to business cycle swings, such as </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf2d" class="" data-page-no="2d">
        <p>These vulnerabilities are further constraining policy room to support weakening activity (see Section on developing country policies). Large fiscal deficits and high government debt dampen the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus (World Bank 2015d, Figure 1.14). Rising foreign currencydenominated debts, or rollover requirements generate risks from sharp depreciations or from spikes in interest rates (Chow et al. 2015). This requires central banks to take financial stability into greater account than otherwise when considering monetary stimulus to support activity, even when inflation expectations are anchored. Outlook </p>
        <p>Baseline projections assume that 2015 marked a low point for developing country growth (Figure 1.15). Growth is expected to rise to 4.8 percent in 2016, similar to the pace in 2014, and to 5.3 percent in 2017 and 2018. This modest improvement is predicated on continued momentum in high-income countries, a stabilization of commodity prices, still accommodative monetary policy in major economies with no bouts of financial market turbulence, and a continued gradual slowdown in China. With stabilizing commodity prices, growth in commodity exporters is expected to resume. Among low-income countries, growth is mostly steady or rising. However, forecasts for 2016 have been downgraded for some countries from previous projections, reflecting lower commodity prices and rising security and political tensions in some countries. </p>
        <p>The persistent growth slowdown in emerging and developing economies has led to repeated forecast downgrades. The largest emerging markets are among the countries subject to significant downward revisions to their long-term forecasts in recent years. Many of the factors underpinning the slowdowns low commodity prices, weak global trade, and slow productivity growth are expected to persist (World Bank 2015e, World Trade Organization 2015). Also, developing countries will likely face rising borrowing costs. In particular, countries with large borrowing needs and high levels of dollar-denominated debt could be adversely impacted by rising U.S. interest rates. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf2e" class="" data-page-no="2e">
        <p>Underneath these broad trends, there is considerable heterogeneity in regional growth outlooks (Figure 1.16). In the East Asia and Pacific region, a gradual slowdown is underway. In Europe and Central Asia, weakness in the eastern part, mainly due to developments in Ukraine and spillovers from Russia, is offsetting improvements in the western part resulting from recovery in the Euro Area. In Latin America and the Caribbean, persistently weak commodity prices and domestic challenges will continue to weigh on regional growth. In the Middle East and North Africa, an international agreement expected to lift international sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran is pushing up regional growth. South Asia will be a bright spot, reflecting improved conditions in India. And growth in Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to be negatively impacted by low commodity prices and infrastructure constraints, although low-income countries are expected to remain resilient. </p>
        <p> East Asia and Pacific. Growth is estimated to have slowed to 6.4 percent in 2015, and is expected to decelerate to 6.3 on average in 2016-18, reflecting the gradual slowdown in China and a sluggish recovery in the rest of the region. Growth is expected to rise modestly in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2016</p>
        <p>18, as political tensions subside in Malaysia, and reforms are implemented to spur investment growth in Indonesia. In Thailand, growth is expected to remain weak, at 2-2.7 percent in 2016-18, as political uncertainty continues to weigh on private investment, and high household debt constrains private consumption. Among the large developing </p>
        <p>ASEAN economies, growth in the Philippines and Vietnam will benefit from rising household incomes caused by low commodity prices, a diversified and competitive export base (Vietnam), and investment driven by robust FDI flows. Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, stemming from a larger-than-expected slowdown in China and tightening global financing conditions. </p>
        <p> Europe and Central Asia. Growth is estimated to have dipped to 2.1 percent in 2015 the slowest rate since 2009. This reflects the combination of an unexpectedly sharp output contraction in Ukraine, slowdown in all major energy-exporting economies of the region, and negative regional spillovers from Russia. Growth in Ukraine may start rebounding, helped by easing tensions and the IMF supported stabilization program. Economic activity in Turkey will benefit from low fuel prices, but will face headwinds from tepid export demand (including negative effects from Russian sanctions) and tighter external financing conditions. Regional growth is projected to strengthen to an average of 3.0 percent in 2016 and 3.5 per cent in 2017-18, helped in part by the ongoing Euro Area </p>

        <p>recovery, though there are several downside risks to the outlook, including possible escalation of geopolitical tensions and continued recession in Russia and Ukraine. Latin America and the Caribbean. After three years of slowing growth, activity in the broader region is estimated to have contracted by 0.9 percent in 2015, as it grappled with the protracted decline of commodity prices and domestic challenges weighing on the region s largest economies. Declining demand and wage rigidities have led to deteriorating labor market conditions and rising unemployment (World Bank </p>
        <p>2015f). However, there are substantial differences among the sub-regions. Bearing the brunt of the slump in commodity prices, along with domestic headwinds, developing South America s output is estimated to have declined 2.1 percent in 2015, including a contraction of 3.7 percent in Brazil. In contrast, estimated growth rates for developing Central and North America and the Caribbean were significantly more favorable, at 2.7 and 3.3 percent, respectively. For the region as a whole, stagnation is still predicted in 2016, followed by a modest recovery of about 2.2 percent in 2017-18, as commodity prices stabilize and some of the policy challenges in large economies subside. The current recession in Brazil is expected to extend into 2016 reflecting tight macroeconomic policy and, particularly, a loss of consumer and investor confidence partly due to political uncertainty. Although weighed down by low oil prices and associated fiscal pressures, growth is expected to pick up in Colombia and Mexico thanks to robust demand from the U.S. market, dividends from implementation of structural reforms (Mexico), and a peace agreement with insurgents (Colombia). </p>
        <p> Middle East and North Africa. Growth is estimated at 2.5 percent in 2015, unchanged from 2014. Among oil exporters, growth mostly slowed or was negative in 2015. The one exception was Iraq, where oil production has risen despite security problems. Oil exporters are grappling with the economic consequences of low oil prices; most oil importers are seeing benefits. Despite low oil prices, growth in the region will accelerate to above 5 percent in 2016-18. The improvement is predicated on a strong recovery in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the region s largest developing economy. The international agreement to suspend or remove sanctions on international trade and financial transactions, beginning in 2016, is an important supporting factor for the Iranian economy (Devarajan and Mottaghi 2015). </p>
        <p>The agreement stands to have positive spillover effects for oil-importing neighboring countries, but might have negative effects on developing oil exporters in the region if additional oil production and exports put downward pressure on international oil prices (Ianchovichina, Devarajan, and Lakatos forthcoming). Risks to the regional outlook are tilted to the downside and arise from both low oil prices and protracted domestic security challenges. </p>
        <p> South Asia. Growth is projected to accelerate to 7.5 percent in 2016-18, from 7.0 percent in 2015 the fastest pace among all developing regions. Falling oil prices have improved investor and consumer confidence, and domestic policy reforms in India and Pakistan have reduced vulnerabilities. Domestic risks include a stalling of the reform process and political tensions in some countries. High levels of problem loans on bank balance sheets remain a challenge to financial stability and to the supply of credit for productive investment (World Bank 2015g). External risks stem from potential volatility amid tightening global financial conditions and weak remittances from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. </p>
        <p> Sub-Saharan Africa. Growth slowed to an estimated 3.4 percent in 2015, the lowest rate since 2009, due to low commodity prices and infrastructure constraints. A rebound is expected in 2016-18, as these headwinds wane, providing some support for government spending and private investment. A modest </p>

        <p>recovery is projected in Nigeria and South Africa, the region s two largest economies. For Nigeria, the forecast assumes that uncertainty around government policy is lessened; that fuel and power shortages become less severe; that fiscal consolidation tapers off; and that import costs decline. In South Africa, labor and social tensions, high unemployment, and constraints associated with electricity supply will continue to weigh on activity. However, low-income countries may register relatively high growth, supported by large-scale infrastructure investment and resilient consumer spending. Overall, growth in the region is projected to accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2016, strengthening further to 4.7 percent in 2017-18. Overvalued currencies and larger fiscal and current account deficits over the period 2011-14 have eroded policy buffers, thus limiting policy options should shocks arise (World Bank 2015h). </p>
        <p>Downside risks dominate and have become increasingly centered on emerging and developing countries, as a gradual recovery in major high-income countries takes hold. A slowdown in China, and widespread weakness across other BRICS, could have substantial spillovers on other emerging and developing economies. Financial market turbulence triggered, for instance, by spikes in borrowing costs during the U.S. tightening cycle or by rising risk aversion could significantly impact capital flows to the more vulnerable emerging and developing economies and intensify balance-sheet vulnerabilities. Commodity exporters and countries with large imbalances and policy uncertainty are particularly exposed to these risks. While past experience suggests that isolated terrorism-related events amid heightened global geopolitical risks do not appear to have lasting economic consequences, escalation could have uncertain regional and global repercussions. As yet, unrealized gains from declining oil prices for importers pose an upside risk. Global growth prospects have become more uncertain, and risks are more skewed to the downside, than in the June 2015 forecasts. Rising uncertainty is evidenced by heightened volatility in global financial markets and a greater dispersion of private sector forecasts for global growth, interest rates, and inflation. While the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted to the downside, the likelihood of a global recession in 2016 appears to be low, as world GDP per capita (measured in 2010 US$) was still growing by an estimated 1.5 percent in 2015.6 The downside </p>

        <p>risks do though have the potential to exert a significant drag on global growth. </p>
        <p>Slowdown in China </p>
        <p>Although the growth slowdown in China continues to be gradual, downside risks to growth may have increased. Baseline growth forecasts are predicated on the assumption that reforms will continue, and that the authorities will maintain sufficient buffers to ensure an orderly rebalancing. Domestically, the main short-term risk is the unwinding of high leverage in sectors with excess capacity. This may cause a sharper-than-expected slowdown in investment, especially in residential estate, and hence in aggregate demand (Figure 1.17). Debt levels are high and continue to rise despite decelerating credit growth. Total (public and private) debt relative to GDP is larger than in most other developing countries, and is also above levels observed in economies affected by the Asian crisis in 1997. However, public debt is estimated at less than 40 percent of GDP or 60 percent if off-budget liabilities are included and is predominantly held domestically. This provides the government with the fiscal space to deploy stimulus in the event of a sharper-than-expected slowdown (IMF 2015c). </p>
        <p>Capital controls on portfolio investment and bank lending, as well as a largely state-owned financial system, limit the risk of financial instability and disorderly capital outflows. If reduced confidence in the financial system leads to attempts to convert local currency deposits into foreign currency, the resulting spike in demand for foreign currency could be met, for instance, with the ample central bank international reserves, estimated at over $3 trillion. </p>
        <p>Over the last decade, China has become a major driver of demand for developing-country exports and a key source of investment and, most recently, finance (Eichengreen, Park, and Shin 2012). Trade linkages with China are significant for the East Asia region, and for commodity exporters globally; hence, the transmission of any growth fluctuation through trade should be larger for those countries. This effect would be amplified through the impact on international commodity prices. Countries with impaired macroeconomic policy buffers could be particularly affected. Financial stress in one or several commodity exporters could outweigh potential real income gains for importers in the short term, hence adding downward pressure on global growth. </p>
        <p>Widespread weakness across the BRICS </p>
        <p>A growth slowdown in BRICS could have global repercussions, dampening growth across emerging and developing economies. A 1 percentage point growth slowdown in the BRICS as a whole could result in a 0.8 percentage point decline in growth in other emerging market countries over a span of two years (Figure 1.18, Chapter 3). Growth shocks in Russia would reverberate across the ECA region, reducing ECA growth almost one-for-one. In contrast, the international spillovers from growth shocks in Brazil, India, and South Africa are not likely to be widespread. In the event of acute stress in any of the BRICS, confidence in emerging market assets more broadly could suffer from contagion effects, in which case spillovers could be considerably larger. </p>
        <p>Such spillovers would transmit through a number of channels (Chapters 2 and 3). China is deeply integrated into supply chains in East Asia and the Pacific, and constitutes a large export market for commodity-exporting countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Brazil trades significantly with neighboring Latin American countries, partly as a result of regional free trade agreements. Remittances from Russia account for more than 10 percent of GDP in several countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia (Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan). India is an important source of foreign direct investment and official development assistance for neighboring countries (Bhutan, Nepal).7 </p>

        <p>Financial market turbulence </p>
        <p>Amid lingering developing-country vulnerabilities, the risk of financial turbulence in some emerging and developing economies has increased. This risk is exacerbated by an expected tightening in global borrowing costs and financial conditions, the potential for further U.S. dollar appreciation, the possibility of heightened risk aversion, and worsening creditworthiness in emerging and developing economies. </p>
        <p>U.S. monetary policy tightening. Tighter U.S. monetary policy may affect the outlook for global borrowing costs. The adjustment may be smooth, as rising U.S. policy rates have long been anticipated by markets in the context of a robust recovery in the United States. At the same time, other major central banks will continue their very accommodative policies, likely dampening the global impact of higher U.S. interest rates. However, this baseline of a modest and smooth U.S. tightening is subject to substantial risks (Figure 1.19). First, the U.S. term premium is unusually low and well below its historical average, and could rebound abruptly. Second, market expectations of future policy rates remain well below those of Fed policymakers following a first hike in December, 2015. A sudden closing in this gap could be disruptive. Third, fragile market liquidity conditions, even in deep sovereign bond markets, could amplify the impact of the initial shock and facilitate its propagation to other market segments. This context increases the risks of spikes in U.S. long-term yields and of financial market and exchange rate volatility. </p>
        <p>U.S. dollar strength, currency exposures, and corporate debt. A further appreciation of the U.S. dollar could add pressure on emerging and developing country currencies. This could contribute to a rising cost of debt refinancing and expose vulnerabilities in domestic corporate and banking sectors. Considering the negative correlation between commodity prices and the dollar, this effect could be reinforced by a negative income effect for some exporters (Druck, Magud, and Mariscal 2015). In the past, periods of rapid dollar appreciations were sometimes associated with a greater incidence of financial crisis in </p>

        <p>emerging markets, such as during the first half of 1980s in Latin America and second half of the 1990s in Asia. In the latter episode, countries with currencies tightly connected to the dollar experienced a greater proportion of sudden stops and sharper economic downturns (IMF 2015b). High and rising levels of private indebtedness increase the risk of corporate defaults. Banking sectors generally remain well capitalized, but corporate debt represents a significant share of their assets, despite rising intermediation through bond markets in recent years. Widespread corporate distress could impair capital and reduce collateral values, constraining the supply of bank finance for the rest of the economy. </p>
        <p>Risk aversion and contagion effects. An abrupt increase in risk aversion triggered, for instance, by a sudden increase in global interest rates, by heightened concerns about debt in key developing countries, by a credit event in a major emerging market, or by rising geopolitical tensions could lead to contagion affecting other economies, even if they have limited vulnerabilities. In particular, further credit downgrades in large emerging market economies could cause a general reappraisal of risk. Market-implied ratings, based on credit default swap prices, indicate heightened investor concerns about exposures to weak commodity prices, soft growth, and political risks. In a financial stress situation, pro-cyclical behavior of asset managers could amplify asset price movements and contagion effects. </p>
        <p>Capital flow reversals and the cost of sudden stops. The materialization of the aforementioned risks could have significant effects on borrowing conditions and have a sizable adverse impact on developing-country capital flows (Arteta et al. 2015). A 50 basis point (two standard deviations) jump in global long-term interest rates could temporarily reduce aggregate capital flows to developing countries by 0.9 percentage points of their combined GDP, with the effect peaking after one year (Figure 1.20). Analogously, a 10 point (two standard deviations) shock in the VIX index of implied stock-market volatility (a proxy for risk aversion) could reduce aggregate developingcountry capital flows on impact by up to 2.2 percent of GDP, with the effect dissipating rapidly. Financial stress associated with these events could combine with domestic fragilities and increase the risks of multiple sudden stops across more vulnerable developing countries. The shortrun costs of these events could be substantial. In the two years following a sudden stop, developing countries could experience an average decline in GDP of almost 7 percentage points, a drop in investment of more than 21 percentage points, and currency depreciation vis-á-vis the U.S. dollar of about 14 percentage points more than before the event. </p>

        <p>Weak commodity prices and other risks for low-income countries </p>
        <p>Although all commodity prices have declined sharply from their 2011 peaks, they are still higher in real terms than their 1985 to 2004 average. While geopolitical risks and adverse weather conditions could lead to a more rapid recovery in commodity prices than currently predicted, most of the risks are on the downside. Since nearly twothirds of current LICs are commodity exporters, the fall in commodity prices in recent years has dealt a major terms of trade shock and led to a substantial widening of fiscal and current account deficits. Further weakness in global commodity prices could result in even sharper fiscal and currency adjustments. It could also lead to delays in investments in energy and mining, particularly in East African countries. Fiscal risks are elevated in several countries in East Africa, relating to sharp increases in public debt due to large infrastructure projects, public-private partnerships, contingent liabilities, and devolution processes (Mauro et al. 2015). Other risks involve political tensions and security issues (Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Nepal, Niger), upcoming elections (Benin), and labor disputes (Niger, Sierra Leone). </p>
        <p>Slower potential output growth </p>
        <p>Slowing actual and potential growth amid lingering vulnerabilities has left developing countries more susceptible to external and domestic shocks. Potential growth in developing countries has declined steadily since the global financial crisis, mainly reflecting the trend slowdown in total factor productivity growth (Figure 1.22). The slowdown in potential output and productivity growth reflects slowing efficiency gains as well as demographic trends, which have passed a turning point since the global crisis with potentially profound implications (World Bank 2015b). Looking ahead, falling fertility rates and rising life expectancy will intensify these trends in countries with ageing populations, which may put additional pressures on productivity growth and, more broadly, on GDP growth. In particular, by 2025, outright declines in working age populations are expected in Europe and Central Combined risk of BRICS weakness and financial stress </p>
        <p>The spillover effects from a synchronous BRICS slowdown could be much more pronounced if it is combined with a tightening of risk spreads that could result from developing-country financial stress. The BRICS slowdown scenario discussed earlier, when combined with tightening financial conditions for instance, the EMBI spread increasing by 100 basis points from the current level in 2015 could cut growth in emerging and frontier markets by about 1.3-1.5 percentage points in 2015 (Figure 1.21). The effects of such a financial market turbulence would be more muted on the advanced economies. Global growth would decline about 0.9-1.2 percentage point in 2015 from the baseline forecast. Financial tightening would reduce growth particularly sharply in frontier markets, with their less liquid, more volatile, and fragile financial markets. </p>

        <p>Asia partly as a result of emigration and in East Asia and the Pacific. South Asia and SubSaharan Africa are exceptions, since still-high population growth will lead to an increase in the share of the working-age population. Although these trends should support stronger growth in pre- and early-dividend regions, these also face the highest poverty rates. Without improvements in poverty headcount rates, these regions could experience even greater concentrations of global poverty in the future. </p>
        <p>Terrorism and geopolitical tensions </p>
        <p>Recent terrorism-related violence in France and elsewhere has raised security concerns and highlighted rising geopolitical risks. Experience from past terrorist attacks in major economies suggests that isolated events are unlikely to have lasting economic consequences. Direct costs and the fiscal impact of security and emergency measures were generally limited, while effects on confidence and activity were generally short-lived. Even in the case of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, financial markets and business confidence recovered within a few months (Figure 1.23).8 Other terrorist attacks in Europe, such as the Madrid and London bombings in 2004 and 2005, had similarly small effects on their respective economies and no perceptible global impacts (Kollias et al. 2011). The negative effect of terrorism on economic activity is generally estimated to be considerably smaller and less persistent than that related to external wars or internal conflict (Blomberg, Hess, and Orphanides 2004). It is also viewed as less pronounced in high income countries, with negative short-term effects offset by rising government spending. </p>
        <p>However, repeated threats or escalating geopolitical risks could potentially have more significant adverse effects. These include a more protracted impact on consumer and investor confidence, disruption to travel and tourism, heightened risk aversion, and higher transaction and insurance costs (IMF 2001, Johnston and </p>

        <p>A flaring up of geopolitical risks in the Middle East remains a significant risk, as tensions have increased and non-conflict countries have been affected by terrorist activity in 2015 (including Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey).10 Security concerns also remain prominent in some Sub-Saharan countries (Cameroon, Chad, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria) as well as in South Asia, with Afghanistan beset by domestic security and insurgency challenges. Taken together, a significant rise in geopolitical risks could potentially affect regional prospects and might, in a scenario of escalating tensions, disrupt an already fragile global recovery. Upside risk: Unrealized gains from the oil supply shock </p>
        <p>The expected positive effect of falling oil prices on large oil importers and hence on global activity has been surprisingly muted. The increase in retail trade and private consumption across major highincome countries has fallen short of the real income gains conferred by lower energy prices since mid-2014 (Figure 1.24). There are several reasons for the muted response. First, the speed of the decline in oil prices has put severe strains on both private and public sector balance sheets among major oil exporters, with significant crossborder spillovers for regional trading partners. Second, oil importers are reacting with caution. High indebtedness, limited room for additional monetary policy accommodation, and slowing long-term growth prospects have encouraged debt reduction and precautionary savings, rather than consumption and investment. Empirically, there is evidence that increased oil price volatility may have a depressing effect, particularly on consumer durables and investment outlays (Kilian 2011; Plante and Traum 2012; Guo and Kliesen 2005; Elder and Serletis 2010; Kilian 2014). Should this uncertainty decline, the positive effects in Nedelescu 2005). In developing countries, the rising number of terrorist incidents and related conflict have already inflicted significant economic, social and humanitarian costs for the affected countries. In 2014 alone, roughly 80 percent of the people killed in terrorist activities were in just five countries (Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Syria), with significant cross-border repercussions.9 The global cost of </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf37" class="" data-page-no="37">
        <p>importing economies represent an upside risk to baseline forecasts. Stable lower oil prices could eventually release pent-up demand. Such delayed reaction to lower oil prices was observed in the 1980s and 1990s, especially in the United States, where consumption initially slowed as consumers were unsure whether lower prices would persist (IMF 2015d). As prices stabilized at lower levels, savings dropped and spending accelerated. </p>
        <p>Challenges in major economies </p>
        <p>In major high-income countries, monetary policy is expected to tighten very gradually in the United States, and to remain highly accommodative elsewhere. Fiscal consolidation is also expected to ease, but most major economies have yet to put in place plans for medium-term fiscal sustainability. China faces the policy challenge of supporting a gradual slowdown and rebalancing while limiting financial vulnerabilities. However, the authorities retain significant policy buffers, and the government is proceeding with its comprehensive reform agenda. United States. U.S. labor market conditions have made significant headway over the last year, but there is still considerable uncertainty about the underlying strength of the economy, and the amount of remaining slack. This has led to a debate about where policy interest rates are heading over the medium term. According to U.S. Fed policy makers, short-term interest rates should stabilize around 3 percent over the long-run, reflecting a gradual increase in the natural rate of interest from current low levels (Figure 1.25). However, uncertainty around estimates of this natural rate could imply a more gradual increase in policy rates than suggested by simple policy rules (Hamilton et al. 2015). Conditions at present therefore warrant a very gradual normalization of policy rates, balancing the risk of raising too quickly and potentially derailing the recovery, against that of raising too slowly and seeing accelerated inflation. Very low interest rates carry the additional risk of potentially excessive risk taking amid a search for yield (IMF 2015d). Signs of rising credit risks are already present, with weakening underwriting standards and an increasing volume of funds flowing to lower-rated U.S. companies (OCC 2015). The U.S. banking sector has strengthened its capital base since the crisis, but some risks have migrated to non-bank intermediaries which are subject to fewer regulatory and supervisory rules (FSOC 2015). Fiscal deficits have been declining thanks to spending restrictions and stronger growth, but a there is still a need for a comprehensive plan for long-term fiscal sustainability. This will require tax reform, and improved quality of public spending, including infrastructure investment (CBO 2015). Brinkmanship around budget negotiations, </p>

        <p>Reflecting a pickup in growth and low borrowing costs, the aggregate Euro Area fiscal deficit is expected to narrow to 2.0 percent of GDP in 2015. Fiscal policy appears to have been broadly neutral to growth in 2015, a trend that may continue in 2016, although several countries require additional consolidation measures (European Commission 2015b). Countries with available fiscal space could use it flexibly to support the recovery, generating positive crossborder spillovers, especially when cyclical conditions are weak (Auerbach and </p>
        <p>Gorodnichenko 2013), especially as monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound (Goujard 2013 and in t Veld 2013). Effective implementation of the European Investment Plan (catalyzing up to 315 billion in private investment through public funds and guarantees) could also help support growth in countries with limited fiscal space and more fragile banking sectors. </p>
        <p>Efforts to implement structural reforms are moving forward, but greater emphasis is needed to address rigidities and fragmentations of labor, product, and services markets, which are hampering productivity, innovation, and growth. Reforms in core countries could generate significant cross-border spillovers, particularly in the area of innovation policies (Coe, Helpman, and Hoffmaister 2009). Peripheral economies have urgent needs for reform to deal with domestic structural issues (Varga, Roeger, and in t Veld 2014). In response to the unprecedented flow of refugees and migrants along the Eastern Mediterranean-Western Balkans, European policymakers have agreed on a series of short-term actions to rescue and support refugees, while coordinating border policies. Establishing equitable sharing of responsibility for resettlement of refugees and associated financial costs is key, along with upholding EU s law regarding the free movement of people, and addressing the root causes of displacement through development efforts. </p>
        <p>Japan. Amid record-low interest rates, continued vigilance regarding financial stability risks is warranted, in particular through monitoring of balance sheets and the use of stress tests to assess spending, and debt caps remain an important source of uncertainty, sporadically affecting investor confidence and global financial markets. Structural reforms to facilitate re-entry into the labor market and boost labor productivity are needed. Longer-term challenges include stagnating wages for lower-income families, and deteriorating public infrastructure (OECD 2015). </p>
        <p>Euro Area. The ECB s asset purchase program has helped ease financial conditions in the Euro Area. It has reduced bond yields, weakened the euro, and improved the supply of credit (Georgiadis and Grab 2015). It has also mitigated the possible fallout from the Greek debt crisis (European Commission 2015b). Ongoing bank balance sheet repair, and high levels of non-performing loans, may nevertheless continue to constrain the supply of credit in parts of the Euro Area (Figure 1.26). Speeding up the resolution of distressed assets is needed to support bank lending. Further efforts to accelerate capital markets integration could help improve the allocation of credit and support private sector investment. </p>

        <p>Fiscal consolidation has been delayed, and public debt is expected to continue edging up (Figure 1.26). The structural reform agenda is making progress, with important new legislation passed or under consideration by parliament, including in the areas of energy, agriculture, and tax policies. Removing tax-induced disincentives to work, broadening the availability of child-care facilities, increasing the participation of older workers and relaxing immigration restrictions in sectors with labor shortages would help counteract demographic pressures (IMF 2015e). Further reforms to reduce labor market duality, improve corporate governance, deregulate agriculture and domestic services, and eliminate barriers to investment in Japan remain key policy priorities. China. Progress continues to be made in several of the reform areas announced in late 2013.11 According to the preliminary information following the fifth plenum, the 13th Five-Year Plan (FYP) indicative target for GDP growth is likely to be lowered to 6.5 percent (vs. 7 percent in the 12th FYP). By lowering growth targets, Chinese authorities are in a better position to address key short-term risks while promoting the reforms needed for sustained medium-term growth.12 A key policy challenge is to achieve an orderly shift to a more sustainable economic path. The transition will encompass an expanding role for the market and a shift from excessive investment in real estate and manufacturing towards greater domestic consumption and services (Figure 1.27). Achieving this will require policies that facilitate the reallocation of resources from sectors that have accumulated excess capacity to those with higher growth potential. Examples of such policy steps include a gradual removal of implicit state guarantees for loans (e.g. through implementing an integrated budget law and unified fiscal accounting), and allowing the orderly exit of inefficient firms, including stateowned enterprises. In the short term, market discipline in the financial sector should be strengthened to mitigate risks associated with a concentration of leverage among slowing sectors (IMF 2015c). At the same time, ad hoc administrative measures should be gradually replaced by market-based mechanisms so that </p>

        <p>credit is more efficiently allocated (World Bank 2015i). The recent inclusion of the renminbi in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) basket of the International Monetary Fund is an important milestone in the integration of the Chinese economy into the global financial system. </p>
        <p>Structural reforms will help support growth. For instance, removing entry barriers and reducing regulatory and administrative burdens will enhance incentives for private investment. Likewise, implementation of fiscal reforms, such as consolidating the business tax with the VAT, will lower the tax burden and promote investment, particularly in the transportation and financial services sectors. Making more land available for commercial activities will also improve the prospects for service-sector investment and growth. Furthermore, efforts to gradually increase the retirement age could contribute to an increase in labor force participation. Reform efforts to accelerate unification of the urban-rural hukou system would also support more efficient labor markets. Removing barriers to a structural shift towards services could help moderate the trend decline in productivity growth, while an increase in the labor share of GDP is critical to rebalance growth on the demand side from investment to consumption. </p>
        <p>Challenges in developing economies </p>
        <p>In the short term, policy actions need to focus on building resilience against downside risks to growth. As noted above, these risks include a slowdown in major emerging and developing economies, financial sector turmoil amid tighter global borrowing conditions, and persistently low commodity prices. Where cyclical slowdowns are underway, and where there is sufficient policy space, countercyclical fiscal and monetary stimulus can be employed to support activity. Cyclical policies need to be reinforced with longer-term structural measures. These should focus on easing supply side constraints, and offsetting demographic headwinds in the relatively higherincome developing regions, where the working-age share of the population is shrinking. Global poverty will increasingly be concentrated in regions with the highest working-age population growth rates. Policy makers in such regions will face pronounced challenges to ensure productive employment for their expanding labor force. </p>
        <p>Monetary policies continue to diverge between oilexporting and oil-importing countries. The deceleration of inflation in oil-importing countries has allowed some easing in monetary policy. In oil-exporting countries, depreciation pressures have increased inflation and financial stability risks. Several central banks have responded with foreign exchange market intervention (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria), and policy interest rate increases (Angola, Colombia, Kazakhstan) in the second half of 2015. Nevertheless, in several countries, policy rates may still be lower than required to meet inflation targets, particularly among commodity-exporting countries (Figure 1.28).13 In the event of a further slowdown in these countries, central banks may not be able to lower rates further without raising risks to financial stability or inflation. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf3b" class="" data-page-no="3b">
        <p>Greater exchange rate flexibility may help absorb shocks, while conserving foreign exchange reserves. However, this benefit has to be balanced against domestic financial stability and inflation risks, which may be significant in some countries. In Kazakhstan, the shift to a floating exchange rate regime over the past year has raised concerns about the balance sheet risks associated with large foreign currency exposures. In contrast, in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, large fiscal and reserve buffers have allowed fiscal policy to be loosened and currency pegs to remain supported (IMF 2015a). </p>
        <p>Financial globalization, and the rising influence of global interest rates in determining domestic financing conditions, will likely make domestic monetary policy objectives more difficult to achieve (Obstfeld 2015; Sobrun and Turner 2015). This places a premium on credible monetary policy that maintains price stability over the medium term, and institutional reforms that limit the risk of pro-cyclical policies associated with capital flows. </p>
        <p>Policies concerning the joint choice of exchangerate regimes and the use of capital controls are of key importance for emerging and developing economies. Developing countries with fixed exchange rates may choose to use capital controls to give monetary policy a degree of autonomy to achieve domestic macroeconomic objectives. Developing countries appear to be more likely to have controls on capital flows if they also have fixed exchange rates, and that the presence of this effect depends upon the level of income per capita (Chapter 4). In particular, lower-income countries appear to set their policy with respect to capital account measures with less independence relative to their exchange rate policies.14 </p>
        <p>The pro-cyclicality of capital flows has been reflected in domestic credit conditions. Credit cycles have also turned in developing countries, and high stock levels, which are the result of past rapid expansions in credit, remain a source of concern where growth is slowing or economies are already in recession. This highlights the need to reinforce macro-prudential policies aimed at mitigating systemic risk and reducing the procyclicality in domestic financial sectors (World Bank 2015b). Beyond the implementation of counter-cyclical capital buffers under Basel III requirements, macro-prudential frameworks can be strengthened through a range of instruments, including caps on loan-to-value or debt-to-income ratios, dynamic provisioning, and credible stress tests. </p>
        <p>Banking sector vigilance and prudential monitoring also need to be stepped up where credit and solvency risks are high due to dollarized banking systems and currency depreciations (Central Asia and South Caucasus). In Europe and Central Asia and, to a lesser extent, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and SubSaharan Africa, banking sectors are weighed down </p>
      </div>

        <p>countries. For commodity exporters in SubSaharan Africa, developing Middle East and North Africa, and (to a lesser extent) Latin America and the Caribbean, fiscal spending sustained by high commodity prices has been an important driver of growth in the non-tradable sector (IMF 2015g). With revenues under pressure, and relatively small non-oil sectors, major fiscal adjustments have begun in several countries (Angola, Ecuador, Iraq, Nigeria). However, there has been considerable heterogeneity, with some oil-exporters with ample reserves implementing fiscal stimulus to support growth (Kazakhstan, Peru). Breakeven oil prices are particularly high in several Middle East and North African countries (Libya, the Republic of Yemen), and non-oil fiscal deficits exceed 50 percent of non-oil GDP in some GCC countries. In Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador, fiscal revenues over 2015-19 are expected to fall well below peak levels of 2011-14 (IMF 2015). </p>
        <p>Fiscal policy as a countercyclical tool becomes particularly important to address cyclical weakness when monetary policy is constrained by inflation, exchange rate movements, or financial stability risks. However, in order for fiscal policy to be implemented and be effective, economies need to have the necessary fiscal space to employ countercyclical measures (World Bank 2015a). Yet buffers have been significantly depleted since 2009, partly due to stimulus deployed during the Great Recession. Rebuilding fiscal space therefore remains a priority in order to expand buffers and reduce sovereign funding risks in case of an adverse shock. In addition, rebuilding buffers will enhance policy credibility and anchor investor confidence in major developing countries where external and domestic imbalances remain large. Fiscal consolidation could also represent an opportunity for major public expenditure and revenue reforms, for instance through better targeted social welfare spending, subsidy reforms, and more productive public investment spending to alleviate supply side constraints. Governments need to look more closely at the composition and efficiency of public spending and address fiscal risks that may be emerging from the way public infrastructure investments are financed. Better by high levels of non-performing loans, and rising concerns about asset quality and bank solvency (Figure 1.29). This necessitates measures to recapitalize banks and address problem loans and longer-term reforms to improve governance, particularly in countries with a high share of stateowned banks. </p>
        <p>Like monetary policy, fiscal policies have diverged among oil-importing and oil-exporting countries (Figure 1.30). For oil importers, the fall in oil prices has been fortuitous. Coupled with domestic policy efforts, which include reducing energy subsidies, fiscal deficits have shrunk, especially in South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia. In many countries (including Egypt and Lebanon) windfalls were typically saved to rebuild fiscal buffers. This fiscal consolidation amounted to about 0.5 percent of GDP, on average. In some countries, they were used to support investment spending (including India and Peru). Commodity exporters have seen a widening in fiscal deficits due to revenue losses from the resource sector. </p>
        <p>Fiscal consolidation is expected to weigh increasingly on growth in commodity-exporting </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf3d" class="" data-page-no="3d">
        <p>information on sources of fiscal risks from contingent liabilities (e.g., from subnational borrowings, special purpose financial vehicles, and public-private partnerships) and improved public debt management will be of critical importance. Although many commodity exporting developing countries have made progress in enhancing transparency in the extractive sector 11 are compliant with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative only nine have fiscal rules or stabilization funds to act as buffers. Moreover, fiscal policy appears to have become more pro-cyclical in the years following the Great Recession, suggesting the need to further strengthen fiscal management of commodity revenues (World Bank 2015b). </p>
        <p>The deceleration of growth in emerging and developing economies is partly due to slower productivity growth. Structural reforms are therefore essential to support long-term growth. In the short run, a credible reform agenda could help lift investor confidence. In the longer run, reforms that improve economic governance, labor market functioning, and the efficient allocation of capital will help boost productivity, and may also help offset demographic headwinds facing many countries. </p>
        <p>The benefits from governance and business environment reforms are potentially large. Past governance reform episodes in emerging markets have been associated with increased growth rates (Didier et al. 2015). Similarly, large improvements in business environments are associated with a significant increase in annual per capita growth (Divanbeigi and Ramalho 2015). Banking, trade, and agricultural liberalization can have particularly large economic benefits, while lower startup costs, easier registration requirements, improved management practices, and better access to finance, have been linked to more firm entry and employment creation in a range of countries.15 However, reform payoffs may take some time to be realized. It is therefore important to tailor policies to the stage of development and the technology level of the country (Dabla-Norris et al. 2013a-b). </p>
        <p>Structural reforms combined with infrastructure investment can have especially potent growth effects. In China, for example, the long-term increase in real incomes from eliminating hukou restrictions allied to large-scale infrastructure investment is larger than that from infrastructure investment alone (Bosker, Deichmann and </p>
        <p>Roberts 2015). </p>

In late- and post-dividend countries, which exhibit much lower fertility rates and more pronounced population ageing, it will be especially important to mobilize savings for productive investment and reforming welfare systems to ensure fiscal sustainability, while supporting the elderly and more vulnerable (World Bank 2015b). Most countries in East Asia and the Pacific and Europe and Central Asia already have shrinking working-age populations. Incentives for greater or longer labor force participation may offset these demographic pressures. The associated reduction in benefits and increased social contributions could also help increase fiscal space. In many countries in Europe and Central Asia, however, policies need to go beyond reforming transfer and pension systems, and must encompass improvements in health and education that increase productive lifetimes, and labor market reforms that encourage greater participation by older people and women (World Bank 2015l). </p>
        <p>Where the working-age population is expanding, structural reforms are vital for other reasons. In South Asia, for instance, an estimated 300 million-plus working-age adults are expected to enter the labor force by 2040, more than half of them in a handful of historically slow-growing and less-developed sub-regions. Reforms that equip new cohorts of workers entering the labor force with the right skills will accordingly remain key to absorbing the growing workforce. Important areas of policy intervention for South Asian governments include improving access and quality of education, as well as strengthening accountability mechanisms, particularly in public schools (Dundar et al. 2014). </p>

        <p>There are growing concerns that poverty will become increasingly concentrated in naturalresource-based economies, and in fragile and conflict states.

        <p>Major resource discoveries have transformed growth prospects for many LICs. The sharp downturn in commodity prices may delay the development of these discoveries into production. During the pre-production development process, macroeconomic vulnerabilities in these economies may widen as a result of large scale investment needs. This heightens the importance of reducing lead times between discovery and production. Over the medium term, lead times may be reduced by improved quality of governance. Growth has eased in LICs but continued to be robust at about 5 percent in 2015, sustainedby public investment, rising farm output and continued mining investments. For 2016-17, strengthening import demand in major advanced economies should help support activity in these countries. Introduction </p>
        <p>The surge in commodity prices over the past decade has played a pivotal role in spurring faster growth in low-income countries (LICs). As industry exploration and investment spending climbed to record highs, a spate of commodity discoveries notably giant oil and gas discoveries in East and West Africa has transformed the long-term growth outlook in several countries (World Bank, 2015a and b).1 Mining has expanded rapidly in many LICs in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade. For example, the number of active industrial gold mines reached historic highs by 2011 across SubSaharan Africa after half a decade of soaring gold prices (Tolonen 2015). </p>
        <p>However, with the turn in the commodity supercycle, industry spending on investment has dropped sharply.2 In Africa the number of oil rigs for on-land drilling has already fallen by 40 percent from their peak in Q1 2014 (Figure SF.1), and mining production has been disrupted in Sierra Leone and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). There are risks of delays in major mining and energy projects under development in East African LICs that could affect growth prospects. In Uganda, for instance, slower-than-anticipated infrastructure development has already delayed oil production start dates, from 2016 to as late as 2020. In Tanzania and Mozambique, final investment decisions on major LNG projects have yet to be made (Bennot, 2015).3 In Afghanistan, investment plans for the development of copper and iron ore mines leased for development in 2008 and 2012 have been significantly scaled back. </p>
        <p>Project delays are detrimental for several reasons. They prolong the period of heightened vulnerabilities associated with the pre-production investment and delay the boost to growth that is typically associated with production. Additional concerns arise in hydrocarbon projects where delays may increase the risk of stranded assets as global efforts to tackle climate change induce a shift towards less carbon-intensive technologies and greater energy efficiency (Stevens et. al. 2015, Carbon Tracker Initiative 2004, McGlade and Ekins 2015).4 Such stranded assets pose financial and growth risks to the companies that own or operate them and the governments that back them. </p>

      <div id="pf48" class="" data-page-no="48">
        <p>This Special Focus discusses the evolution of macroeconomic vulnerabilities during the development of major resource discoveries, the impact of slowing commodity prices on development times, and policies to shorten these times. The analysis rests on a dataset for gold and copper discoveries worldwide since 1950 </p>
        <p>(proprietary to MinEx Consulting). Over this period, gold and copper discoveries have accounted for two-thirds of non-ferrous discoveries worldwide. The results shown here therefore are illustrative of the impact of policies and commodity prices on project development. This Focus addresses the following issues: </p>
        <p> What are typical lead times between discovery and production? </p>
        <p> How do economies evolve between commodity discovery and production? </p>
        <p> What factors determine the lead time between discovery and production? </p>
        <p> What are growth prospects for LICs? </p>
        <p>Lead times between discovery and production </p>
        <p>Typically, developing a resource discovery requires large upfront investments, over a considerable period. During this time, there may be high uncertainty about prices and macroeconomic and policy environments (IMF, 2012a). </p>
        <p>Broadly, the process of development of most mines undergoes five major stages. Since crosscountry data is not publicly available, four of these stages are illustrated in Figure SF.2 for two copper mines, one in the United States and another in Mongolia. The process begins with exploration to establish the existence of a potentially commercially viable deposit (4-5 years in the two illustrative examples).5 Once such a deposit is confirmed, feasibility, environmental and other impact studies are conducted and financing plans developed to establish commercial viability. Once commercial viability has been confirmed, a mining license is obtained, a process that can take several years in some countries (2-3 years, on average, in Africa; Gajigo et al. 2012). Finally, the duration of construction of the physical facility (3 years in the two illustrative examples) depends on the accessibility of the deposit. </p>
        <p>All steps depend on the quality of governance, the reliability of institutions, and macroeconomic stability that facilitates predictable policies. Investment risks tend to be high in the exploration, pre-feasibility and feasibility stages, and decline as a deposit gets closer to production. Stylized facts on lead times by type of commodity and size of deposit are as follows: </p>
        <p> Oil and gas. Conventional discoveries can take 30-40 years to develop (Clo 2000), but lead times for giant oil and gas discoveries can be shorter (Arezki et al. 2015). For oil deposits, </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf49" class="" data-page-no="49">
        <p>such as shale, short lead times of 2-3 years reflect technological improvements since the 1980s, and reduced entry barriers for small, agile firms (Wang and Xue, 2014, World Bank 2015a). Monetizing gas discoveries is harder than oil discoveries: final markets are typically far away, so that simultaneous investments in drilling and transport infrastructure are required, and long-term price contracts need to be agreed with endusers (Huurdeman 2014) </p>
        <p> Mining. Lead times can range from a few years to decades, depending on the type of mineral, size and grade of the deposit, financing conditions, country factors and commodity prices (UNECA 2011, Schodde 2014). </p>
        <p> Copper mining versus other mining. Average lead times for gold discoveries are ten years, but more than 15 years for zinc, lead, copper and nickel discoveries (Schodde 2014). </p>
        <p>Development of most gold deposits tends to begin immediately, whereas a significant share of copper discoveries takes several decades (Figure SF.4). For instance, one-third of copper discoveries since 1950 have had lead times to eventual production of 30 or more years, compared with only 4.5 percent of gold discoveries. Similarly, industry estimates place the period from early exploration to final production of copper mines at close to 25 years (McIntosh 2015). Longer lead times for copper mines reflect greater complexity and greater infrastructure investment to transport the ore to export markets.6 Average lead times to production have fallen sharply in recent decades. </p>

        <p>Resource discoveries matter to the economy only insofar as they can be developed into production. However, since 1950, less than 60 percent of gold, zinc and lead discoveries have made it to eventual production, and less than 40 percent of copper and nickel discoveries (Schodde, 2014). Once developed, the market value of discoveries can be large compared to the size of LIC and MIC economies. For copper mines, for example, production in 2014 alone accounted for 6 percent of LIC GDP and 2 percent of MIC GDP, on average (Figure SF.3). </p>
        <p>Depending on the commodity and the size of discovery, during the lead time between commodity recovery and extraction, countries can accumulate sizeable vulnerabilities as investment rises and external liabilities grow.7 In the dataset used here, investment growth increased sharply in </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf4a" class="" data-page-no="4a">
        <p>the five to ten years before actual extraction of the resource began (Figure SF.3). This effect was only apparent in low-income countries. Since they tend to be smaller and less diversified than middle- and high-income countries, the development of a large mine can create significant domestic demand pressures. Using a global database on giant oil discoveries (those exceeding ultimately recoverable reserves of 500 million barrels), including in Africa, Arezki et. al. (2015a) find that investment growth rises immediately upon discovery and current account deficits widen. GDP growth and private consumption growth respond only once extraction begins. The full increase in GDP growth materializes with commercial production, when vulnerabilities unwind as exports expand. The size of vulnerabilities depends on two factors: how mine construction is financed, whether governments borrow in anticipation of rising commodity revenues in the future, and whether private consumption and investment rises in anticipation of rising incomes. If rising imports and current account deficits are financed by FDI, which tends to be less prone to sudden stops than debt financing, short-term vulnerabilities are more limited (Levchenko and Mauro 2008). </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, a sudden stop in FDI projects could also disrupt foreign exchange markets and sharply dampen activity. In particular, expectations of greater FDI (including as a result of recent natural resource discoveries) can encourage long-maturity non-resource investment projects. If these expectations are not validated, a sudden stop could follow and trigger fire sales of long-term assets and a collapse in activity (Calvo 2014). Additional, fiscal risks arise if governments expand spending and borrow against future commodity revenues. The following examples illustrate the heightened vulnerabilities associated with lead times in a number of LICs. </p>
        <p> Sierra Leone: The discovery of major iron-ore deposits in 2009 led to a substantial upward revision in growth forecasts to over 50 percent in 2012 as mining production came onstream. </p>
        <p>However, work stoppages and a breakdown in the railway system delayed the start of the mine, so that actual growth results were much </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf4b" class="" data-page-no="4b">
        <p>lower than initial projections. Since then, a collapse in global iron ore prices by 50 percent in 2014 has led to severe financial difficulties at the country s two foreign-owned and highly indebted mining operators, with one declaring bankruptcy and the other halting operations (World Bank 2015e, IMF 2012b and 2015a). </p>
        <p>This and the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic set back activity, with the economy estimated to have contracted by 20 percent in 2015. </p>
        <p> Uganda: Oil was discovered in 2006. Although production has yet to start, the government has borrowed in anticipation of future oil revenues. The public debt ratio has nearly doubled since 2007, reflecting loans from Chinese state banks and other lenders to finance large hydropower and other infrastructure projects. With production dates being postponed, infrastructure projects affected by cost overruns, and the current account deficit reaching over 10 percent of GDP in 2015, fiscal risks and external financing risks have increased (World Bank 2015f). </p>
        <p> Mozambique. The discovery of massive gas deposits in 2012 has lifted medium to longterm growth prospects. However, the sharp fall in oil and gas prices since 2014, delays in mining infrastructure projects and highly expansionary fiscal policies are generating major short-term challenges. Public debt ratios have risen sharply from 2007, to finance government infrastructure spending. But with finances under pressure, the country has turned to the IMF for a potential loan program (IMF 2015b). </p>
        <p>Determinants of the lead time </p>
        <p>Lead times to production depend on a wide range of technical, economic, social, and political factors. They include the accessibility and quality of the discovery, commodity prices, and policy environments. Larger discoveries closer to the surface in more predictable policy environments appear to see faster development (World Bank 2015a). Higher commodity prices increase the feasibility of marginal projects, and could accelerate the start of development after discovery (Schodde 2014). Once started, however, sunk costs may make mining companies reluctant to disrupt ongoing projects, particularly if development is already well advanced (McIntosh 2015, Crowson 2011).8 </p>
        <p>A duration analysis helps assess the relative importance of these factors, using a proprietary dataset for the years 1950-2015 provided by MinEx Consulting. It comprises 273 copper discoveries in 46 countries, and 687 gold discoveries in 73 countries. The methodology is a standard survival analysis (Jenkins 2006, Annex SF.1) to estimate the probability of a particular mine reaching production in any given year. Explanatory variables are global gold and copper prices (World Bank 2015d), and the policy environment at the time of discovery, controlling for the physical characteristics of the deposit. A good policy environment conducive for </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf4c" class="" data-page-no="4c">
        <p>resource investment as well as non-resource investment has many dimensions. It includes sound macroeconomic policies that ensure sustainable fiscal positions (as measured by government debt in percent of GDP at the time of discovery), and domestic demand pressures (as proxied by inflation at the time of discovery). A more stable macroeconomic environment can be associated with more predictable tax and expenditure decisions. A conducive policy environment also includes high quality of institutions, at the time of the discovery, that affect mining operations. This is proxied by the World Bank Governance Indicators for Control of Corruption and by the QOG Institute s Index of the Quality of Government.9 These are some of the same conditions that would help avoid the macroeconomic volatility and stunted growth in resource-based economies that has been labelled the resource curse (Sachs and Warner 2001; Mehlum, Moene and Torvik 2002; Humphreys, Sachs and Stiglitz 2007). </p>
        <p>The results suggest an important role for the commodity price cycle, sound macroeconomic management and the quality of governance. Higher commodity prices, on average, are not significant determinants of lead times, probably because of the significant sunk costs involved. However, for copper deposits, an upswing in copper prices at the time of discovery the crucial period when licenses are obtained and exploration and extraction rights negotiated accelerates development. For example, in LICs since 2000, rising copper prices at the time of discovery may have shaved off about two to three years from lead times. For the largest quartile of copper discoveries in LICs since 2000, the price boom may have reduced lead times by 2½ years (Figure SF.4). Sound macroeconomic policies also appear to be important: lowering government debt below 40 percent of GDP, or reducing inflation below 10 percent, accelerates development times by about 10 percent. These variables may proxy for generally sounder and more predictable macroeconomic policies. </p>
        <p>While lower commodity prices could lengthen lead times for copper mines, their effects can be mitigated by strengthened policies. Had the average LIC had the same quality of government index or the same control of corruption index as Chile or Namibia, the lead times for the development of copper discoveries since 2000 might have been shortened by as much as two years (Figure SF.4). </p>
        <p>Policy Implications </p>
        <p>Many low-income countries remain at the frontier of resource exploration and they are expected to be a major source of commodity supplies over the long-term (ICMM, 2012). Under the right conditions, new resource production should boost their exports and growth. With fiscal institutions in place to manage the volatility of resource revenues (World Bank 2015a), new resource production could provide a major opportunity for development over the medium to long term. </p>
        <p>However, the sharp drop in commodity prices since 2014 is already affecting resource sector investments and could further delay the development of discoveries in several LICs. This, in turn, could prolong vulnerabilities inflation, fiscal and balance of payments pressures often associated with resource development as governments and private sectors borrow and invest in anticipation of future income growth. For the largest deposits, a price downturn in the early stages of development, when licenses and extraction rights are negotiated, could potentially delay development by a few years, which could be critical for some LICs with growing fiscal and current account pressures. </p>
        <p>Countries, in which resource development is still in initial stages, could consider accepting further delays to contain vulnerabilities and reduce the long-term risk of stranded assets (Steven et. al. 2015). Where development is already far advanced, this option may be unattractive. In these countries, especially, improvements in business environments could offset some of the </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf4d" class="" data-page-no="4d">
        <p>price pressures on resource development. At the same time, they would benefit non-resource investment and help reduce macroeconomic vulnerabilities (Loayza and Raddatz 2007). Other means of expediting resource developments are likely to be less helpful in the long-run, including increased tax incentives for mining companies. Mining companies have reportedly often negotiated tax exemptions that go above provisions specified in enacted legislation and are higher than warranted by mine profits (Curtis et al. 2009; Gajigo et al. 2012). </p>
        <p>Growth in low-income economies (LICs) eased during 2015, reflecting headwinds from falling commodity prices and security and political tensions (Figure SF.5, Table SF.1). Nevertheless, on average, growth has remained solid at 5.1 percent. </p>
        <p>Growth was particularly strong in several of the largest LICs, sustained by public investment, rising farm output and continued mining investments.10 In oil-importers, including Ethiopia and Rwanda, low commodity prices supported activity. In Ethiopia, the largest LIC economy, growth of 10.2 percent in 2015 was also lifted by good harvests, rising public investment and booming manufacturing and construction. Even in several metal and mineral resource-rich LICs, activity has thus far been resilient despite the commodity price decline, as development of major mining and gas projects has continued (Tanzania, Mozambique, Uganda). Growth in these countries ranged between 5-7 percent during 2015. </p>
        <p>In other commodity-exporting countries, in contrast, the fall in commodity prices led to outright disruptions in production. Sierra Leone s economy, already hit hard by Ebola in 2014, is estimated to have contracted by a fifth during 2015 due to the closure of mining operations at Tonkolili (the second largest iron ore mine in Africa) after its operator when bankrupt. Copper production in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been hit hard, following the suspension of copper and cobalt production at the Katanga Mining unit by Glencore, its mining operator, amid declining profitability and a slump in copper prices to a six-year low. In Afghanistan, large investments associated with the award of copper and iron-ore mining projects have failed to materialize partly due to unsettled domestic security and political conditions, but also due to the fall in global commodity prices weighing on sentiment and outlook, and resulting in a downward revision in medium term growth prospects. Monetary tightening has further weighed on growth as policy makers responded to sharp depreciations by lifting interest rates (Uganda) or drawing down reserves (Burundi, Tanzania, Dem. Rep. of Congo, Zimbabwe and Mozambique). </p>
        <p>In several LICs, political and social tensions are </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf4e" class="" data-page-no="4e">
        <p>taking a toll on economic activity. In Afghanistan, growth has slowed as a result of continued political uncertainty and increase in violence, amidst a drawdown in NATO troops. In Nepal, the estimated value of damage from the earthquakes in April-May 2015 amounts to a third of GDP. Since the earthquakes, domestic tensions due to a new constitution, and severe fuel shortages resulting from the closure of land trading routes through India have further weighed on activity. Political tensions remain elevated in several LICs in Sub-Saharan Africa, as a result of insurgencies or unsettled political conditions (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Niger), upcoming elections (Benin), or labor disputes (Sierra Leone, Niger). This has increased uncertainty and weighed on activity. </p>
        <p>Fiscal and current account deficits have widened in most countries. Falling commodity prices (commodity exporters), political tensions (Burundi), or uneven policy direction (The Gambia) have weakened export and fiscal revenues. In several countries, however, large current account and/or public sector deficits reflect rising infrastructure spending or the construction of mining projects that should support potential growth over the medium term. In Ethiopia for instance, the current account deficit has remained relatively well funded by FDI, as is also the case in Mozambique and Tanzania, while aid inflows have been important in Rwanda. While lower global oil prices have kept inflation pressures muted in some oil importers </p>
        <p>(Afghanistan, Benin, Rwanda), inflation has remained high in several other countries due to limited spare capacity (Ethiopia); large currency depreciations over the past year (commodity exporting LICs) and those where political and social tensions remain high. Nepal has also seen a sharp acceleration in essential food and fuel prices, due to the severe disruption in trade through India. </p>
        <p>For 2016-18, growth in LICs is expected to remain resilient at above 6 percent, on aggregate. Strengthening import demand in the U.S. and Euro Area, which are key trading partners for West African countries, should help support activity in these countries. Large-scale investment projects in mining, energy and transport, consumer spending, and public investment should help keep growth upwards of 7 percent in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Tanzania. Improvements in electricity supply in Ethiopia and Rwanda but particularly in Guinea where supply has doubled with the start of production from the Kaleta dam in 2015 will also support activity, but a shortage of power is expected to remain a drag in Benin and Madagascar. The growth outlook remains weak, and only a gradual recovery is projected due to persistent political tensions in Haiti, Burundi, Benin, Guinea Bissau, Burkina Faso, Nepal and Afghanistan. </p>
        <p>Risks to the outlook are mainly tilted on the downside. These include: </p>
        <p> Further weakness in global commodity prices could require sharper fiscal adjustments in commodity exporters. Several countries have limited reserve buffers to stem depreciation pressures to contain financial stability risks and inflation. Lower commodity prices and high expected investment costs also increase the risk of a delay of investments in energy and mining in East African countries that would weigh on medium-term prospects. </p>
        <p> Fiscal risks are elevated in some countries, relating to large infrastructure projects, Public-Private Partnerships, and contingent liabilities (Mauro et. al. 2015).</p>
        <p>Countries where government debt has risen rapidly in recent years, such as Uganda, to finance mining infrastructure, may find it harder to service debt if production start dates for oil projects are delayed further. Inconsistent and poor macroeconomic management has been accompanied by sizeable fiscal slippages in The Gambia. As a result of growing fiscal pressures from the drop in commodity prices and contingent liabilities in state-owned enterprises, which required government support in 2015, considerable risks remain in Mozambique and have led it into negotiations with the IMF for a fiscal support program (IMF, 2015b). </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf4f" class="" data-page-no="4f">
        <p> Political risks could deter domestic and foreign investment in some countries, weigh on tourism, and add to fiscal pressures. </p>
        <p>Fragmented political situations could also undermine the ability of governments to undertake and implement needed policies. </p>
        <p>One-third of the world s poor are located in LIC countries (World Bank 2015c).11 Their growth prospects are therefore key to reducing global poverty. A robust policy environment can strengthen growth to levels that can make a clear dent in poverty. For commodity-exporting LICs, this includes policies that ensure that the growth potential from natural resources is used effectively: reducing regulatory hurdles, clarifying legislation and strengthening infrastructure. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf51" class="" data-page-no="51">
        <p>The duration model used in the multivariate analysis is a standard accelerated-failure-time (AFT) model (Jenkins, 2006), based on the gamma distribution. In AFT models, the natural logarithm of the survival time, log t, is expressed as a linear function of the covariates, yielding the linear model: where xj is a vector of covariates and β is a vector of regression coefficients. The choice of zj determines the regression method. Here, and based on the Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate the best fit across types of distributions, the standard generalized Gamma distribution appears to be most appropriate. </p>
        <p>The effects of the explanatory variables on the baseline are given by time ratios (the exponentiated coefficients). These are reported below for each explanatory variable. The magnitude of these time ratios denotes the factor by which the expected lead time to production would be shortened or lengthened by a one-unit change in a variable. A one-unit change in the variable changes the time scale by a factor of exp(xj β). Depending on whether this factor is greater or less than 1, time is either accelerated or decelerated. That is, if a subject at baseline experiences a probability of survival past time t equal to S(t), then a subject with covariates xj would have probability of survival past time t equal to S(t) evaluated at the point exp(xj β)t, instead.12 </p>
        <p>The main explanatory variables xi are measures for commodity prices (an indicator if prices are rising at time of discovery and the price change between discovery and production); indicators of macro policy environment (dummies if public debt ratios are greater than 40 percent and inflation rates higher than 10 percent); and measures for governance, including the QOG Institute s ICRG Index of Quality of Governance, and the World Bank Governance Indicator for control of corruption (Dahlberg et al 2015).13 By choosing all these explanatory variables at the time of discovery, i.e. before the lead time begins, concerns about reverse causality are attenuated.14 Given that data on some of these variables (in particular, the governance variables) is not available for much of the 1980s (QOG) or the mid-1990s (governance indicator), the earliest values are taken to indicate the quality of governance for discoveries that occurred prior to those dates. Control variables are the logarithm of the size of the discoveries, a dummy variable for copper deposits, and dummy variables for middleincome and low-income countries. In the absence of mine specific information on the depth of the deposit and in light of the changing depth over time as deposits get depleted, it is not possible to control for this factor directly. Country dummies proxy for unobserved characteristics like the landlocked nature of the country. In addition, regression results are robust to the use of decadal dummies which could help control for the decelerating time to production since the 1950s (See Annex Table SF.1). </p>
        <p>The regression in Column (1) shows that expected times to production are nearly twice as long for copper deposits, and similarly 30-40 percent higher in MIC and LIC countries. High levels of debt and inflation expand the lead times to production. Column (2) shows that high levels of debt and inflation lengthen the lead time to production by 16 and 8 percent respectively. The commodity price cycle measure is not statistically significant, but interacted with copper mine size, shows that copper mines tend to get developed faster when commodity prices are rising.15 Governance variables indicate that when governance improves (indicated by higher values </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf52" class="" data-page-no="52">
        <p>of the corruption index), expected times to production fall by nearly 10 percent. The quality of government index is not statistically significant on its own, but when interacted with the variable indicating a copper deposit, shows that times to production fall by nearly 30 percent when governance improves. </p>

        <p>Since 2010, a synchronous growth slowdown has been underway in emerging markets, especially in some of the largest ones. Given the size and integration with the global economy of the largest emerging markets the BRICS (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, South Africa) a synchronous slowdown in these economies could have significant spillovers to the rest of the world through trade and finance. Specifically, a 1 percentage point decline in BRICS growth is associated with lower growth in other emerging markets by 0.8 percentage point, in frontier markets by 1.5 percentage points, and in the global economy by 0.4 percentage point over the following two years. Spillovers could be considerably larger if the BRICS growth slowdown were combined with financial market stress. Adverse growth spillovers present challenges that need to be addressed with both fiscal and monetary policies as well as structural reforms. prices (which have dampened prospects in the half of emerging markets that are commodity exporters), and bouts of financial market turbulence. Since 2014, however, a series of country-specific, domestic shocks have become the main source of the slowdown (Didier et al. 2015). Such country-specific challenges have included a steady slowdown in productivity growth, bouts of policy uncertainty, and shrinking fiscal and monetary policy buffers that have constrained the use of policy stimulus (Box 3.1). Total factor productivity growth, especially, has almost halved in emerging markets to just over 1 percent, on average, in 2010-14 from about 2 percent in 2000-07, on average. This has been only partially offset by higher capital accumulation, including as a result of crisisrelated investment stimulus in several large emerging markets. </p>
        <p> Structural versus cyclical factors. One-off, cyclical and structural factors have driven the slowdown to varying degrees across countries. On average across emerging markets, longerterm structural factors may have accounted for about one-third of the growth slowdown during 2010-14. In individual countries, however, the contribution of structural factors has ranged from one-tenth to virtually all of the slowdown since 2010. </p>
        <p>The slowdown follows a decade during which record-high emerging market growth transformed the global economic landscape. Emerging markets accounted for 46 percent of global growth during 2000-08 and 60 percent during 2010-14. By 2014, emerging markets constituted 34 percent of Growth in emerging markets (EM) has been slowing, from 7.6 percent in 2010, to 3.7 percent in 2015 and is now below its long-run average (Figure 3.1). This slowdown has been highly synchronized across emerging markets, with significant declines in growth in most emerging market regions.1 In the largest emerging markets the heterogeneous group of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) growth has slowed from almost 9 percent in 2010 to about 4 percent in 2015, on average, with India being a notable exception. This slowdown reflects both easing growth in China, persistent weakness in South Africa, and steep recessions in Russia since 2014 and in Brazil since 2015. </p>
        <p>Both external and domestic as well as cyclical and structural factors have contributed to the slowdown in emerging markets (Didier et al. 2015). </p>
        <p> External versus domestic factors. On average, external factors have been the main cause of the slowdown between 2010-13. Such factors have included weak global trade after the global financial crisis, falling commodity </p>

        <p>global GDP (in current market prices), more than one-and-a-half as much as they did in 1980 (Figure 3.2). The rising share of the emerging world in the global economy was also reflected in their increased integration into international trade and finance. Emerging markets have become major export destinations for the rest of the world and important sources of remittances, commodity supply and demand, foreign direct investment, and official development assistance. </p>
        <p>China is by far the largest emerging market, two- thirds the size of all the other emerging markets combined and twice as large as the other BRICS economies combined. Notwithstanding China s larger size, the broader group of BRICS plays a special role. The BRICS are the largest and most regionally integrated emerging markets in their respective regions and they have been the main source of emerging market growth and integration into the global economy. During 2010-14, the BRICS contributed about 40 percent to global growth, up from about 10 percent during the 1990s. They now account for two-thirds of emerging market activity and more than one-fifth of global activity as much as the United States and more than the Euro Area compared with less than one-tenth in 2000.2 </p>
        <p>This chapter studies the following four questions: What are the key channels of spillovers from the major emerging markets? </p>
        <p> Do business cycles in BRICS move in tandem with those in other emerging markets and frontier markets? </p>
        <p> How large are spillovers from the major emerging markets? </p>
        <p> What are the policy implications? </p>
        <p>Previous studies have typically focused on global growth spillovers from individual BRICS (Box 3.2). The chapter adds to the existing literature on spillovers in four dimensions. First, it extends the analysis to spillovers from a synchronous BRICS slowdown. Second, it includes an explicit comparison of global, regional, and local spillovers from individual BRICS. Third, it systematically differentiates the cross-border spillovers by country groups, including by region and by commodity exporter/importer status. Fourth, in a transparent framework, it examines how turbulence in financial markets can interact with the slowdown in BRICS to generate cross-border growth spillovers.3 </p>

      <div id="pfcd" class="" data-page-no="cd">
        <p>The findings are as follows: </p>
        <p> Channels. Cross-border economic linkages among emerging markets, and with BRICS specifically, have grown significantly since 2000. Reduced import demand from BRICS would weaken trading partner exports. </p>
        <p>In particular, reduced commodity demand would dampen growth in commodity exporters. Lower remittances from Russia would reduce household incomes and consumption in neighboring countries. In addition, although not estimated econometrically here, confidence spillovers could be sizeable and affect a larger group of countries (Levchenko and Pandalai-Nayar 2015). </p>
        <p> Impact. A 1 percentage point decline in BRICS growth would reduce growth in other emerging markets by 0.8 percentage point and in FM by 1.5 percentage points at the end of two years. The estimated impacts on advanced markets are modest, on average. On balance, a 1 percentage point decline in BRICS growth is estimated to reduce global growth by 0.4 percentage point at the end of two years. Notwithstanding sizeable impacts of growth fluctuations in BRICS on other emerging markets and frontier markets, those from major advanced economies remain larger still. Global versus regional effects. A growth impulse in China would affect growth in other emerging markets in East Asia by about as much as growth in other emerging markets around the world. In contrast, the repercussions of a slowdown in Russia would be mostly confined to Europe and Central Asia. Slowdowns in Brazil, India, and South Africa would mainly affect smaller, neighboring countries. </p>
        <p> Interacting effects. Slower-than-expected growth in BRICS could coincide with other strains on the global economy such as bouts of global financial market volatility. If, in 2016, BRICS growth slows further, by as much as the average growth disappointment over 2010</p>
        <p>-14, instead of picking up as forecast, growth in other emerging markets could fall short of expectations by about 1 percentage point and global growth by 0.7 percentage point. If such a BRICS growth decline scenario were to be combined with financial sector turbulence, e.g. similar to the 2013 Taper Tantrum, emerging market growth could slow by an additional 0.5 percentage point and global growth by an additional 0.4 percentage point. Policy responses. The growth slowdown in BRICS has been part cyclical decline from the immediate post-crisis rebound in 2010, part structural slowdown. Hence, a mix of counter</p>
        <p>-cyclical fiscal or monetary policy stimulus and structural reforms could be used to support activity. A renewed structural reform </p>

This would be especially useful for countries that have limited room for expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. </p>
        <p>A growth slowdown in emerging markets, in particular in one or several of the BRICS, could have significant spillover effects given their share of global output and growth. They have become important export markets and significant sources of remittances. Some of them also supply foreign direct investment (FDI) and official development assistance (ODA) to other emerging markets, frontier markets, and low-income countries (LIC) as well as advanced markets. </p>
        <p>Global output and growth. Since 2000, emerging markets have accounted for much of world growth. During the pre-crisis years of 2003-08, emerging market growth averaged 7.1 percent, well above its long-term average of about 5 percent. During the crisis, global activity was shored up by emerging markets, despite a sharp slowdown in 2008. Partly as a result of large-scale </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfd1" class="" data-page-no="d1">
        <p>stimulus in the largest emerging markets, they continued to grow in 2009, when the rest of the world contracted, and they expanded strongly in 2010. Frontier markets have grown almost as rapidly as emerging markets since 2000, though from a smaller base, to 4.6 percent of global GDP in 2014. </p>
        <p>Global trade. Emerging markets now account for 32 percent of global trade (compared with 16 percent in 1994). This has partly reflected their deepening integration into global supply chains. For example, the value added from emerging markets embedded in U.S. or Euro Area exports nearly doubled to about 7 percent in 2011 from 3 percent in 2000. Among emerging markets, the BRICS have accounted for most of the increase in trade flows to emerging markets and frontier markets between 2000 and 2014 (Figure 3.3). Most of the emerging markets value-added trade with other emerging markets and frontier markets is with the BRICS. As the largest economies in their respective developing country regions, the BRICS also account for a sizeable share of regional exports. </p>
        <p>Global commodity markets. BRICS have played a significant role in global commodity markets (World Bank 2015c). Rapid growth in China s industrial production through the 2000s was accompanied by a sharp increase in demand for metals and energy. Virtually all of the increase in global metals demand and more than half of the increase in global primary energy demand between 2000 and 2014 originated in China (Figure 3.4).4 India s demand for primary energy and metals has also grown rapidly but less than China s, partly as a result of more services-based growth (World Bank 2015b). Large emerging market and frontier market commodity producers have benefited from this increased demand for their products. For several commodities, a few individual emerging markets and frontier markets accounted for 20 percent or more of global exports (e.g. Indonesia for nickel, aluminum and coal; Chile for copper; Russia for oil; and Brazil for iron ore and soybeans; World Bank 2015c). </p>
        <p>During the 2000s, high prices and improved technology encouraged the development of new capacity, including U.S. shale oil production, new copper mines in Eritrea and new oil fields in </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfd2" class="" data-page-no="d2">
        <p>Myanmar (Baffes et al. 2015, World Bank 2015c). The commodity super-cycle, however, began to unwind in early 2011 when most commodity prices began to slide as new capacity came onstream at the same time as growth in major emerging markets increasingly tilted away from commodity-intensive industrial production. Oil prices were initially kept high by OPEC production cuts but, in the second half of 2014, halved with OPEC s policy shift towards targeting market share. </p>
        <p>Global finance. Emerging markets have started playing a major role in a wide range of global financial flows, including foreign direct investment, banking and portfolio investment, remittances and official development assistance. Foreign direct investment (FDI). Since emerging market growth prospects remain better than those in many advanced markets, emerging markets have attracted a large amount of FDI (30 percent of global FDI inflows, on average during 2000-14). Most of this amount, about two-thirds, has been received by the BRICS. Among BRICS, China is not only the single largest recipient country of FDI inflows, it has also become an important source country for FDI, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and other natural resource-producing countries (World Bank 2015c). </p>
        <p> Banking and portfolio investment. Although from a low starting point, bank claims and portfolio investment to emerging markets have doubled since the early 2000s to about 6 percent and 5 percent of global GDP, respectively. As with FDI, BRICS account for a sizeable portion of these flows. From a much smaller base, global banking flows to frontier markets have also risen, to 1 percent of global GDP in mid-2015. </p>
        <p> Remittances. Emerging markets are now among the largest source and destination countries for remittances, accounting for 40 percent of global remittance in- and outflows. Five emerging market and frontier market source countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Russia, Saudi </p>
        <p>Arabia, and United Arab Emirates) account for 20 percent of global remittance outflows. Emerging market and frontier market recipient countries such as Egypt, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Pakistan, and Vietnam account for 28 percent of global remittance receipts. Remittances from the BRICS are significant, particularly for the ECA and SAR regions (Figure 3.5). </p>
        <p> Official development assistance (ODA). The GCC countries, especially Saudi Arabia, </p>
        <p>Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, provided significant ODA to Egypt in 201014 (on the order of 7 percent of GDP in Fiscal Year 2013/14). China has become an important source for Sub-Saharan Africa while India is providing ODA to Bhutan amounting to 37 percent of GDP in Fiscal Year 2015/16 </p>
        <p>(World Bank 2015c). </p>

      <div id="pfd3" class="" data-page-no="d3">
        <p>The rising role of BRICS in the world economy suggests that growth fluctuations in their economies could lead to sizeable spillovers to other emerging markets and frontier markets. As the group of emerging and frontier markets has established stronger intra-group trade and financial linkages, common movements in their business cycles have become more pronounced. Growth fluctuations in major emerging markets tend to lead growth in other emerging markets and frontier markets. In addition, growth slowdowns in major emerging markets have been associated with lower growth in other emerging markets and frontier markets and, to a much lesser extent, in advanced markets. </p>
        <p>Emergence of an emerging-frontier market business cycle.</p>
        <p>The drivers of business cycles can be decomposed into global, group, and countryspecific factors. This decomposition exercise is conducted for a sample 106 countries (advanced markets, emerging markets and frontier markets, and other developing countries, Annex 3.1). The global factor represents business cycle fluctuations that are common to all countries and to output, investment and consumption. The group-specific factor captures fluctuations that are common to a particular group of countries, in this case to the group of emerging and frontier markets, and the group of advanced markets and the group of other developing countries. </p>
        <p>The degree of business cycle synchronization among emerging and frontier markets is captured by the contribution of the factor specific to emerging-frontier markets (EM-FM-specific factor) to variations in their growth. The EM-FM factor explained a small part of growth fluctuations before the 1980s, when emerging and frontier markets were little integrated with each other (and with the global economy). Since then, a common EM-FM-specific factor has emerged that now accounts for about a quarter of the variation in growth in emerging and frontier markets almost as much as the global cycle (Figure 3.6).5 These results suggest that a more pronounced EM-FM business cycle has emerged over time. Hence, the risk has increased that adverse developments in BRICS could be a source of a broader synchronous downturn across the EM-FM group. Higher synchronization of growth fluctuations. Since the global financial crisis, BRICS growth has become increasingly correlated with growth in other emerging markets and frontier markets, but also with growth in advanced markets. Lead correlations correlations between BRICS growth and other emerging market, frontier market, and advanced market growth in the subsequent quarter are sizeable, suggesting the possibility of spillovers from BRICS growth to these countries (Figure 3.7). In contrast, lag correlations with BRICS growth and other countries are generally small.</p>

        <p>Lower growth during slowdowns in BRICS. An event study suggests that slowdowns in BRICS have been accompanied by lower growth in other emerging markets and frontier markets and, to a much lesser extent, in advanced markets. There were seven slowdown episodes which are defined as troughs in BRICS growth over five-quarter rolling windows from 1997Q2-2015Q1.6 During these episodes, BRICS growth was, on average, about 2 percent, compared with the long-run average of 5 percent. Although there is wide variation, median emerging-frontier market growth fell by almost a percentage point during these BRICS slowdowns, and median advanced market growth eased by about one-quarter percentage point (Figure 3.8). BRICS growth shocks appear to have been at least partly transmitted through declining imports. </p>
        <p>Commodity prices especially energy prices decelerated sharply, and emerging-frontier market export growth slowed during these episodes. These findings together point to the possibility of significant growth spillovers from the BRICS to other emerging and frontier markets. However, the growth slowdowns in other emerging markets and frontier markets during episodes of lower growth in BRICS may have been pure coincidence, or the result of a common external adverse shock. The next section presents a formal econometric analysis of growth spillovers from BRICS that addresses these concerns. </p>
        <p>In order to quantify growth spillovers from BRICS to the global economy and to other emerging markets and frontier markets, a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model, with a recursive identification scheme, is estimated for 1998Q1 2015Q2. The model includes growth in G7 countries as a measure of activity in advanced markets; proxies for global financial conditions (U.S. 10-year sovereign bond yield and EM Bond Index EMBI); growth in BRICS; oil prices; growth in emerging markets excluding BRICS; and growth in frontier markets.7 Spillovers are inferred by tracing out the responses to a one-off exogenous shock to BRICS growth that reduces it by 1 percentage point on impact.8 Spillovers from BRICS. A growth slowdown in BRICS could reduce global growth and, especially, growth in other emerging markets and in frontier markets. On average, a 1 percentage point decline in BRICS growth could, over the following two years, reduce global growth by 0.4 percentage point, growth in other emerging markets by 0.8 percentage point and growth in frontier markets by 1.5 percentage points (Figure 3.9).9 The stronger response of frontier markets to BRICS growth fluctuations may reflect the smaller size and greater openness of most frontier markets than emerging markets.10 </p>
        <p>In contrast, the estimated impact on G7 growth is, on average, modest and statistically insignificant in the structural VAR model. This may reflect both pro-active countercyclical policy in G7 countries and their net oil-importing status. G7 central banks tend to respond to external shocks, including those from BRICS, with accommodative monetary policy. To the extent that this is not fully controlled for, measured spillovers are small (Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieiri 2009). Furthermore, as net oil importers, G7 economies tend to benefit from the </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfd7" class="" data-page-no="d7">
        <p>lower oil prices induced by a BRICS slowdown. That said, slowdowns in BRICS can weigh on growth in individual advanced markets that have strong trade links with the BRICS, notably Germany and Japan. Confidence effects although not explicitly captured econometrically here could also amplify spillovers as discussed in detail later. </p>
        <p>While rapid growth in BRICS has buttressed global growth, its synchronous deceleration since 2010 (India recently being the exception) has contributed to the slowdown in other emerging markets and frontier markets. In China, policies have helped rein in growth in excess capacity sectors. Geopolitical tensions, sanctions, and falling oil prices in Russia and falling commodity prices and political tensions in Brazil have weakened investor sentiment. In South Africa, energy bottlenecks and labor unrest have weighed on growth. The associated slowdowns (China, South Africa) and recessions (Brazil, Russia) have dampened imports (including commodity imports) from trading partners, remittances to Central Asia, and FDI flows from major emerging markets. In a decomposition of historical contributions to growth, the BRICS slowdown since 2010 appear to have accounted for the bulk of the growth slowdown in other emerging markets and frontier markets between 2010 and 2015.11 </p>
        <p>Spillovers from G7.</p>
        <p>Spillovers from BRICS remain smaller than those from advanced markets (Figure 3.10). After two years, a decline in G7 growth reduces emerging market growth by one</p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfd8" class="" data-page-no="d8">
        <p>third more and frontier market growth by one-half more than a similarly sized growth slowdown in BRICS. Over the sample period, G7 growth shocks explain about 30 percent of the variation in emerging and frontier market growth at the twoyear horizon, compared with 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively, explained by BRICS growth shocks. This is true for both aggregate emerging market growth (excluding BRICS) and frontier market growth as well as for growth in most individual emerging and frontier markets in the sample used here. </p>
        <p>Stronger spillovers from G7 countries reflect their larger economic size. While the BRICS account for one-fifth of global GDP, G7 countries account for almost half of global GDP. In addition, G7 countries account for a larger share of global trade and play a central role in global finance.12 Financial flows can quickly transmit shocks originating in G7 economies around the world. Spillovers from individual BRICS. In order to analyze spillovers from individual BRICS, the VAR model is re-estimated by replacing aggregate BRICS growth with growth in each BRICS economy, one at a time. The magnitude of spillovers varies across the BRICS (Figure 3.11).13 A 1 percentage point decline in China s growth could reduce growth in non-BRICS emerging markets by 0.5 percentage point and in frontier markets by 1 percentage point over two years whereas a similar shock in Russia would reduce growth in other emerging markets by 0.3 percentage point. Spillovers from a growth shock in Brazil to other emerging markets would be much smaller and to frontier markets, statistically insignificant. In general, spillovers from India and South Africa to other emerging markets and frontier markets would be much smaller and/or statistically insignificant.14 </p>
        <p>The magnitude and reach of spillovers from major emerging markets reflect their size and integration. In current dollar terms, China s economy is more than four times the size of the next-largest BRICS economy (Brazil); its imports are six times the size of those of Russia; and its demand for primary energy and metals is four to ten times the size of that of India. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfd9" class="" data-page-no="d9">
        <p>In order to analyze the regional implications of spillovers from individual BRICS, countryspecific VAR models are estimated for each spillover destination country (Annex 3.2). Whereas growth fluctuations in China would have global repercussions, those in other BRICS tend to radiate more narrowly. A growth impulse in China changes growth in other emerging markets in East Asia by about as much as growth in other emerging markets around the world. On the other hand, a 1 percentage point growth slowdown in Russia reduces growth in other emerging markets in Europe by 0.4 percentage point over two years but its impact on growth outside the region is negligible. Brazil has a small impact even on its own region.15 A sufficiently long time series of quarterly GDP data for a strict comparison is unavailable for other emerging markets in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, but there are indications that spillovers from South Africa and India to their respective regions are modest (Box 3.3). </p>
        <p>Transmission channels of spillovers.</p>
        <p>Commodity markets are a key transmission channel of spillovers (Box 3.2). China accounts for 30 percent or more of global demand for copper, iron ore, nickel, aluminum and soybeans and 10 percent of global demand for coal. Among the largest producers of these commodities are Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Peru, Philippines, and Poland (World Bank 2015d). This is reflected in country-specific VAR model estimates (Figure 3.12).16 As a result of these commodity price declines, growth in commodity exporters could slow by somewhat more than growth in commodity importers.17 </p>
        <p>Another important channel of spillover transmission is trade. China s rapid trade integration since its WTO accession in 2001 has increased the potential for global spillovers from growth shocks. In addition to emerging and frontier markets, several advanced markets are also among China s closest trading partners, including Germany and Japan. A Global Vector </p>
        <p>Autoregressive (GVAR) model is employed to estimate spillovers to a large number of advanced, emerging, and frontier markets from a growth slowdown in China, specifically through the trade channel. </p>
        <p>To examine the implications of the growing trade presence of China, two sets of estimates are </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfda" class="" data-page-no="da">
        <p>derived. The first assumes bilateral trade links as in 1998-2000 (when China accounted for 3 percent of global trade). The second assumes trade links as in 2010-12 (when China accounted for over 8 percent of global trade).18 For the majority of countries, and especially Brazil among emerging markets and the United States, Japan, and Canada among advanced markets, stronger trade linkages have raised the estimated spillovers.19 </p>
        <p>The magnitude of spillovers from BRICS could be more pronounced if shocks are amplified via the confidence channel (Box 3.2). A sharp slowdown in a large BRICS economy could lead to general reassessment of investor risk sentiment. This could trigger a plunge in prices of emerging market assets, currency depreciations, equity market drops, and bond yield spikes across emerging markets. In the analysis here, such spillovers are only partially captured through the impact of a BRICS shock on the EMBI which then feeds into growth elsewhere. In the event of a severe adverse shock to BRICS, however, the EMBI could spike more sharply and the distress spread through a greater range of financial markets than suggested by these, essentially linear, response estimates. Synchronous slowdown in BRICS. A synchronous slowdown in BRICS would have considerable global growth effects (Figure 3.13).20 A synchronous BRICS slowdown is defined as one in which BRICS growth declines by the same amount as an isolated decline in growth in China. Activity in China s trading partners that are also closely linked to their regional BRICS would be doubly hit. As a result, emerging market, frontier market, and global growth could decline by around 0.1-0.2 of a percentage point more, over two years, in a synchronous BRICS slowdown than in an isolated slowdown in China. </p>
        <p>With every year of slowing BRICS growth, the probability increases that the slowdown turns into an outright recession, as household, corporate, and government buffers erode and expectations of future growth prospects shift downwards (Didier et al. 2015). A synchronous, steepening BRICS growth slowdown could considerably depress emerging and frontier market growth and weigh on advanced market and global growth as well (Figure 3.14). If, for example, BRICS growth persisted at its current weak levels (3.2 percent annualized) through 2017 instead of the currently projected pickup, the rest of emerging market growth could slow by about 0.4 percentage point from the baseline forecast in 2016 and about 1 </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfdb" class="" data-page-no="db">
        <p>percentage point in 2017.21 The impact would be considerably larger if BRICS growth were to slide below current levels. For instance, if BRICS growth slowed by as much as the average forecast downgrade during 2010-14 (0.2 percent), growth in the rest of emerging markets and in frontier markets could fall 1-1.3 and 0.5-1.5 percentage points below the baseline forecasts in 2016-17, respectively. Growth in G7 countries would fall considerably less, by about 0.3-0.6 percentage point during 2016-17. Overall, global growth would decline by about 0.7-1.1 percentage points below the baseline forecasts in 2016-17. </p>
        <p>A perfect storm: BRICS weakness combined with financial turmoil. The current BRICS growth slowdown coincides with tightening global financial conditions. In December 2015, the U.S. Federal Reserve increased monetary policy rates for the first time since the global financial crisis and is expected to continue to gradually raise policy rates. In all likelihood, this tightening cycle will proceed smoothly as it has long been anticipated, and would have only a modest impact on emerging and frontier markets. </p>
        <p>However, the tightening cycle carries significant risks of financial market turmoil. This could be accompanied by a broad-based repricing of emerging and frontier market assets and sizeable declines in capital inflows to emerging and frontier markets (Arteta et al. 2015). Investor sentiment could deteriorate sharply on weakening emerging and frontier market growth prospects. As a result, risk spreads for emerging and frontier market assets could widen steeply and raise overall financing costs for emerging and frontier markets, further dampening growth. An increase in financing costs can also reduce policy space, in particular fiscal space, limiting the firepower that countries need to respond to slowing growth (World Bank 2015c). </p>
        <p>A synchronous BRICS slowdown could have much more pronounced spillover effects if it is combined with a tightening of risk spreads. When combined with tightening financial conditions, e.g. EMBI increasing by 100 basis points from the current level in 2015 (an increase comparable to the taper tantrum), the BRICS slowdown could cut growth in other emerging markets by about 1.3-1.5 percentage points and in frontier markets by 1-1.8 from the baseline forecasts in 2016-17 (Figure 3.14). Global growth would decline about 0.9-1.2 percentage points in 2016-17 below the baseline forecast. Financial tightening could reduce growth particularly sharply in frontier markets, with their less liquid, more volatile and fragile financial markets. </p>
        <p>Emerging and frontier market policies can play an important role in mitigating the persistence and depth of spillovers from slowing BRICS growth. The appropriate policy response depends on the nature of the shock and the spillovers: </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfdc" class="" data-page-no="dc">
        <p> A cyclical downturn in BRICS would generate temporary adverse spillovers that could be mitigated by counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies; </p>
        <p> A structural downturn in potential growth in BRICS would require structural reforms in other emerging markets to adjust to a new normal of lower growth in core trading partners and sources of remittances. </p>
        <p>About one-third of the growth slowdown in emerging markets, including BRICS, is structural and the remainder is a cyclical downturn from the immediate post-crisis rebound of 2010 (Didier et al. 2015). However, this assessment of the relative strength of cyclical and structural factors is subject to considerable uncertainty. Hence, the optimal policy mix, even in countries where spillovers from external shocks are considered temporary, includes structural policies to improve medium- and longterm growth prospects. </p>
        <p>In addition, counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies can be used effectively when there is sufficient policy space (see discussion below). Many emerging and frontier markets used up </p>

        <p>the largest infrastructure deficits have been identified for low-income countries and frontier markets, emerging markets also lag by global comparison. </p>
        <p>However, most emerging markets do not have the policy room to sustain fiscal stimulus over anything other than the briefest period. much of their policy space during the global stimulus of 2009 and have yet to rebuild it (World Bank 2015a). They may therefore not be in a position to implement effective counter-cyclical stimulus. Faced with this predicament, structural reforms to lift long-term growth could help, bolster investor sentiment in the short run, help lift domestic demand to the extent they encourage investment, and support capital flows even amidst financial market tightening. </p>
        <p>The appropriate policy response also depends on the source of the external shock. A growth shock may be more appropriately addressed with fiscal policy and structural reforms whereas a financial shock may be more effectively mitigated by monetary, exchange rate, or financial policies. The boundaries between these shocks and policies, however, may at times be blurred. This argues, again, for a policy mix of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy coupled with structural reforms. </p>
        <p>Fiscal policy. Fiscal stimulus could help stabilize a cyclical slowdown in activity. Fiscal multipliers the change in real GDP generated by a 1 dollar increase in fiscal spending for emerging markets are up to 0.6 in the short-term and up to 0.9 in the medium-term (World Bank 2015a). Fiscal multipliers tend to be larger during recessions than expansions, in countries with ample fiscal space, in less open economies, and for stimulus conducted through expenditure increases, especially public investment, rather than tax cuts (World Bank 2015a; Ilzetzki, Mendoza, and Vegh 2013). </p>
        <p>A spillover-induced, cyclical slowdown in activity may be an opportunity to address sizeable infrastructure needs in emerging markets, since infrastructure investment can be a particularly effective form of fiscal stimulus.22 While some of </p>

        <p>shocks. Some commodity-importing emerging markets with low inflation, in contrast, may have some room to dampen external shocks with further interest rate cuts. However, once oil prices stabilize and inflation begins to rise, this room may diminish. </p>
        <p>Structural policies. The BRICS slowdown may turn out to be a sustained, structural decline in growth potential rather than a temporary cyclical downturn. This would generate spillovers that force other emerging markets to face an era of lower growth in key trading partners and sources of finance. The potential for spillovers will increase as BRICS integrate further into the global economy and as BRICS growth continues to outpace advanced market growth </p>
        <p>(notwithstanding the recent slowdown). While at times politically challenging to implement, structural reform measures can help emerging markets adjust to this new era. </p>
        <p>Structural reforms have collateral benefits of buttressing investor confidence and lifting domestic demand whether in the event of cyclical or structural external shocks. By lifting investor confidence in growth prospects, they can support capital inflows amidst financial market Oil exporters that have entered the oil price slump of 2014 with large surpluses and low debt (Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United </p>
        <p>Arab Emirates) can still smooth the adjustment to external shocks. However, in most oil-exporting emerging markets, surpluses have already turned into sizeable deficits and rising debt. </p>
        <p> In several non-oil commodity-exporting emerging markets, deficits have widened by more than a percentage point from a less favorable starting position (Brazil, Chile, Peru) and debt has risen above 50 percent of GDP in 2015 (Brazil, Colombia). Further deterioration in fiscal sustainability could weaken investor sentiment. </p>
        <p> Similarly, several commodity-importing economies entered the emerging market growth slowdown in 2010 with deficits above </p>
        <p>4 percent of GDP and debt above 50 percent of GDP (Egypt, Hungary, India, and Poland), and deficits remain elevated despite consolidation efforts (Figure 3.15). </p>
        <p>Monetary policy. Like fiscal policy, monetary policy could boost growth amidst a temporary slowdown in activity.23 Effective monetary policy stimulus, however, relies on well-functioning financial markets (Lane 2003; Chinn 2014); limited balance sheet exposures to exchange rate and interest rate risk; well-anchored inflation expectations; and policy credibility in the eyes of investors. </p>
        <p>However, room for monetary policy stimulus has narrowed in many emerging markets. To contain inflation and financial stability risks resulting from sharp depreciations, several commodity-exporting emerging markets have been forced to tighten monetary policy despite faltering growth (Figure 3.16).

        <p>turmoil. To the extent structural reforms are associated with investment especially in the presence of economic slack or with increased labor force participation, they can also increase domestic demand (World Bank 2015a). </p>
        <p>Gains in long-term growth from structural reforms could be particularly large in emerging and frontier markets because they tend to display elevated inter-sectoral dispersion in productivity and because some struggle with pervasive misallocation of capital and labor.24 A growing literature has documented the long-term benefits from structural reforms in emerging and frontier markets, especially of reforms that improve governance and business environments. These include growth spurts triggered by reforms (Figure 3.17, Didier et al. 2015), amplification of the growth dividend from public investment, greater job creation and formal sector activity. For example, the growth slowdown in 2010-14 was least pronounced in the quartile of countries with the strongest governance environment reforms and most pronounced in those with the weakest governance environment reforms (Figure 3.17). Over the next few years, growth in BRICS is likely to face persistent headwinds from low commodity prices, weak trade, and higher borrowing costs. Meanwhile, productivity growth is likely to remain weak as populations age in large emerging markets, and investment weakness slows the adoption of new technologies. A weaker external environment, and slowing growth, may further erode policy buffers and constrain the use of counter-cyclical stimulus to support activity. The strengthening recovery in advanced markets is expected to only partially offset these risks. The results presented in this chapter suggest that continued weakness or a further slowdown in BRICS growth could add to the challenges faced by emerging and frontier markets from a deteriorating external environment. It would </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfe3" class="" data-page-no="e3">
        <p>weigh on growth in other emerging markets as it has done already since 2010 and frontier markets. Activity in close trading partners of BRICS and in commodity exporters would be particularly susceptible to a setback. </p>
        <p>In response to a 1 percentage point decline in BRICS growth, growth in other emerging markets and in frontier markets could slow by 0.8 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, over two years. This would set back global growth by 0.4 percentage point, over two years. </p>
        <p>There is a risk that growth weakness in BRICS will be accompanied by bouts of financial market volatility through the U.S. monetary policy tightening cycle, or in some cases domestic factors. If, instead of the projected pickup, BRICS growth slows further by as much as the average growth disappointment over 2010-14 and if financial conditions tightened moderately such as during the financial market turmoil of the summer of 2015 global growth could be cut by one-third in 2016. </p>
        <p>Policy makers in emerging markets may need to support activity with fiscal and policy stimulus, at least where policy buffers are sufficient. In all cases, countries could derive substantial gains from well-designed, credible structural reforms that retain investor confidence and capital flows in the short-run, and that lift growth prospects for the long-run. </p>

        <p>A. VAR models </p>
        <p>The chapter uses a structural vector autoregression model to quantify growth spillovers from BRICS to other countries, in particular emerging markets (EM) excluding BRICS and frontier markets (FM). Exogenous shocks to BRICS growth are identified using a recursive scheme, and then the spillover effects of those shocks are traced out. The recursive identification scheme requires quarterly data, and hence spillover analysis in this chapter is limited to those countries for which quarterly data is available.1 In the baseline (aggregate) model, the variables included are, in this order: G7 growth, the U.S. interest rate, Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI), BRICS growth, oil price, emerging market (excluding BRICS) growth, and frontier market growth.2 The ordering is based on the presumed exogeneity, or predetermination, of variables where more exogenous variables are ordered first. For instance, it assumes that G7 growth is exogenous to emerging market growth: G7 growth shocks affect emerging market growth within a quarter, whereas shocks to emerging market growth can affect G7 growth only with a lag of at least one quarter. By ordering oil price after BRICS growth, the chapter implicitly assumes that oil prices are relatively endogenous to BRICS growth. </p>
        <p>G7 growth, taken to be the proxy for growth in the advanced economies, is constructed as the weighted average of the growth of individual G7 economies, the weights being their respective average GDP shares during the estimation period, 1998Q1-2015Q2. BRICS growth is similarly constructed as the weighted average of growth of individual BRICS countries. Emerging market and frontier market growth are constructed as the weighted average of growth of individual emerging markets minus BRICS and frontier markets respectively.3 The U.S. interest rate (the yield on 10-year U.S. treasury bills) and the EMBI serve as proxies for global financial conditions. The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques and inferences are made using 2000 Monte Carlo draws. A lag length of four quarters is used, which is standard for VAR models estimated with quarterly data. </p>
        <p>To evaluate growth spillovers from each of the individual BRICS countries, the model above is re-estimated by replacing aggregate BRICS with the individual BRICS country in question as the spillover source. For instance, to obtain growth spillovers from Brazil, the model is re-estimated by including Brazil s growth instead of aggregate BRICS growth. Positive or negative correlations between growth of individual BRICS could bias the estimates upwards or downwards. </p>
        <p>While the baseline model is used to infer spillover implications for aggregate global, emerging market, and frontier market growth, an alternative (country) specification is deployed to evaluate spillover effects for each emerging market and frontier market. This specification is used in the chapter to understand the intra- and inter-regional spillover effects from a growth slowdown in BRICS countries. Among the BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia, and China matter empirically for spillovers (Figure 3.11). To preserve model parsimony, the alternative specification considers spillovers only from these three countries. The model is estimated for each emerging market and frontier market (as spillover destination country) one at a time with the following variables: G7 growth, EMBI, China s growth, Brazil s growth, Russia s growth, commodity prices, emerging market/frontier market growth, and emerging market/frontier market real effective exchange rate. Simultaneously including all three spillover source countries (China, Brazil, and Russia) in the model allows estimating spillovers from one source </p>

      <div id="pfe6" class="" data-page-no="e6">
        <p>country (e.g., Brazil) while explicitly controlling for the rest of the spillover source countries (China and Russia). </p>
        <p>Commodity prices are weighted by the average share of exports of each commodity in the commodity export basket of the spillover destination country in question. With respect to the baseline model, including trade-weighted commodity prices (instead of oil prices) and the real effective exchange rate in the model results in a better empirical description of the small open economies in the sample. Finally, again in the interests of parsimony, U.S. interest rates are excluded in the alternative specification. The results are, however, robust to inclusion or exclusion of U.S. interest rates. </p>
        <p>The estimation uses a balanced panel of quarterly observations for 57 countries between 1998Q1 and 2015Q2. Real GDP for 29 of these countries is based on the quarterly database in Ilzetzki, Mendoza, and Vegh (2013) which is extended to 2015Q2 by splicing real GDP series from the OECD Quarterly National Accounts and Haver Analytics. Real GDP data for the remainder of the 28 countries are sourced from the OECD Quarterly National Accounts and Haver Analytics. Real effective exchange rates are the narrow (wherever available) and the broad indices from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) supplemented with the Bruegel database. The EMBI spread series is taken from J.P. Morgan. The U.S. long-term interest rate is the 10-year generic government yields from Bloomberg. Nominal oil prices are obtained from the World Bank Pink Sheet and deflated using seasonally adjusted U.S. CPI series from Haver Analytics.4 The trade-weighted commodity prices for each emerging market/frontier market are constructed as follows: nominal monthly prices of 35 commodities are obtained from the World Bank pink sheet.5 As in the case of oil prices, these nominal commodity prices are deflated by the U.S. CPI. The resulting real prices are converted into indices by setting January 2010 as 100. Then, the monthly indices are converted into quarterly indices by taking averages across the months in a given quarter. Country-specific trade weights are then applied to these real quarterly commodity price indices to yield a trade-weighted real commodity price index for each country. For a given country, the trade weights are the average share of exports of each commodity in the total commodity export basket during the period 20072014. Commodity exports are defined in terms of SITC 4th revision at 4 digits from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database. </p>
        <p> While estimating the model, some of the data are transformed to yield stationary series. Thus, real GDP, oil and commodity prices, and real effective exchange rate, originally in levels, are converted into quarter-on-quarter growth rates. Any residual linear trends in those growth rates are removed. The U.S. interest rate and the EMBI are first differenced. The baseline (aggregate) VAR model uses aggregate GDP growth rates for various geographic regions and/or market groups. Those are calculated as the GDP weighted growth rates of all the countries in a given region/group. The GDP weights are calculated using the annual constant GDP (2005 US$) series from the World Bank s World Development Indicators. </p>
        <p>B. Dynamic factor model </p>
        <p>Dynamic factor models are widely used for identifying common elements in national business cycles (for an extensive discussion see, for instance, Kose, Otrok, and Prasad 2012). This chapter estimates a dynamic factor model that captures common factors in the fluctuations of real output, private consumption, and private investment over the 1960 2015 period in 106 countries using annual data obtained from the World Economic Outlook database. Specifically, the model decomposes fluctuations in these variables into four factors: </p>
        <p> A global factor captures the broad common elements in the fluctuations across countries. Group factors capture the common elements </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfe7" class="" data-page-no="e7">
        <p>in the cyclical fluctuations in the countries in a particular group. In this paper, the world is divided into three regions: advanced markets, emerging and frontier markets, and other developing countries.6 </p>
        <p> Country-specific factors capture factors common to all variables in a particular country. </p>
        <p> Residual ( idiosyncratic ) factors capture elements in the fluctuations of an individual variable that cannot be attributed to the other factors. </p>
        <p>Dynamic factor models are designed to extract a small number of unobservable common elements from the covariance or co-movement between (observable) macroeconomic time series across countries. Thus, the model allows for a more parsimonious representation of the data in terms of the unobservable common elements typically referred to as factors. From a theoretical standpoint, dynamic factor models are appealing because they can be framed as reduced-form solutions to a standard Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. </p>
        <p>The dynamic factor model used in this paper has 106 blocks of equations, one for each country. For instance, the block of equations for an emerging market economy, say Mexico, takes on the following form: </p>
        <p> where Y, C, and I denote growth in output, consumption, and investment respectively. The global, EMFM (group), and country factors are represented by , and respectively; and the coefficients before them, typically referred to as factor loadings, capture the sensitivities of the macroeconomic series to these factors. The error terms are assumed to be uncorrelated at all lead and lags and follow an autoregressive process. The same block of equations is repeated for each country in the three regions in the system. The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques as described in Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman (2003). To measure the importance of each factor, we compute variance decompositions that decompose the total volatility of output growth into volatility components due to each factor. This is achieved by applying the variance operator to each equation in the system. For the case of output in the example above, </p>
        <p>Since there are no cross-product terms between the factors because they are orthogonal to each other, the variance in output attributable to the global factor is: </p>
        <p>The variance share due to the regional and country factors and the idiosyncratic term are calculated using a similar approach. </p>
        <p>C. GVAR model </p>
        <p>Originally proposed in a seminal paper by Pesaran, Schuermann and Weiner (2004), the GVAR methodology presents a simple and practical alternative to overcome the dimensionality problem ( curse of dimen sionality ) on the macro-econometric study of global macro-linkages. </p>
        <p>The GVAR approach can be briefly described in two steps. In the first step, country-specific smalldimensional VAR models are estimated, which include domestic variables and cross-sectional averages of foreign variables. In the second step, the estimated coefficients from the countryspecific models are stacked and solved in one large system, which is used in this report for impulseresponses analysis. </p>
        <p> 6For the list of countries included in each region, see Annex 3.1. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pfe8" class="" data-page-no="e8">
        <p>For the estimation of the marginal model for the dominant variables, d, feedback effects from xt are allowed. Thus, we have the following expression for the marginal model: </p>
        <p>Following Pesaran et al. (2004) the chapter proceeds to estimate the individual VARX* in equation (2) on a country-by-country basis. The marginal model (3) is also estimated by least squares. Once the estimations have been carried on, we stack together the N models of equation (2) and the models in equation (3) and solve it all as one global system, explicitly taking into account that . </p>
        <p>The GVAR model is estimated for 32 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. The estimation period is 1998Q1-2014Q4. </p>
        <p>Three endogenous variables are considered: real output, the rate of inflation, and the real effective exchange rate. Due to the limited degrees of freedom, only one country-specific foreign variable is considered and constructed from real output. The fixed trade weights are defined as the average trade flows computed over a given period of time. These weights are used for the estimation of the individual models but also later on for the solution of the GVAR. </p>
        <p>Finally, price indices for oil and metals are included in the model as dominant variables. </p>
        <p>In a single-country VAR, exact identification of shocks is commonly achieved by imposing a few restrictions derived from economic theory. However, in the case of a GVAR, exact identification of shocks would require an Consider a panel of N countries, each featuring ki × 1 of endogenous variables observed during the time periods t=1, 2, , T. Let xit denote a vector of ki × 1 of endogenous variables specific to country i in time period t, and let xit = (x'1, x'2 , x'N)' denote a ki × 1 vector of all the variables in the panel, where k = ki . </p>
        <p>A set of small-scale, country-specific conditional models can then be estimated separately. The individual models explain the domestic variables of a given economy, xit, conditional on countryspecific cross-section weighted averages of foreign variables, . The foreign variables' expression is as follows: </p>
        <p>These weights are constructed using data on bilateral foreign trade. xit is modelled as a VARX* model, namely a VAR model augmented by the vector of the foreign variables and their lagged values: </p>
        <p> for i = 1,2, N, where , l = 1,2, , pi , , for l = 1,2, , qi, are ki × ki and ki × k* matrices of unknown parameters, respectively, and are ki × 1 vectors of errors. Foreign variables in country-specific models are treated as weakly exogenous for the purpose of estimation of unknown coefficients of the conditional country models. The assumption of weak exogeneity can be easily tested and is often not rejected when the economy under consideration is small relative to the rest of the world and the weights used in the construction of the foreign variables are granular . Common variables in the country models are introduced as dominant variables as defined in Chudik and Pesaran (2013). Thus, (1) becomes: </p>

Consequently, the generalized impulse responses proposed by Pesaran and Shin (1998) are used, which produce one unique set of responses. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this approach does not attempt to recover any structural shocks. Instead, this methodology describes how the system reacts after a specific historical/observable shock, taking into account the correlation among shocks. </p>
        <p>D. The benefits of reform </p>
        <p>Values in columns of Figure 3.17A are based on a panel data regression in which the dependent variable is real GDP growth. A reform spurt (setback) is defined as a two-year increase (decrease) by two standard deviations in one or more of the following four measures of the WGI index: regulatory quality, government effectiveness, rule of law, and control of corruption. The WGI indicators are principal components of a wide range of survey-based and other indicators. For each index, the standard deviation is measured as the average of the standard errors of the WGI index in the beginning and at the end of each two-year interval. Episodes in which there were improvements in one measure and simultaneous setbacks in another are excluded. The sample spans 64 EM and FM over 1996-2014. This approach yields 50 episodes of significant reform spurts and 47 episodes of reform setbacks (Didier et al. 2015). </p>
        <p>Let t denote the end of a two-year spurt or setback. The coefficients are dummy variables for spurts and setbacks over the [t-3, t+2] window around these episodes. In Figure 3.17A, Reform denotes the t=[-1,0] window (i.e. during the two years of improvement/deterioration). Pre-reform denotes the t=[-3,-2] window. For each window, each column shows the sum of coefficients. All coefficients show the growth differential of economies during an episode compared to those that experienced neither improvements nor setbacks. All estimates include time fixed effects to control for global common shocks and country fixed effects to control for time-invariant heterogeneity at the country-level. Under robust standard errors, estimates during the reform spurt window are jointly significant at the 10 percent level, and likewise for the reform setback window. The growth differentials during reform spurts associated with IMF programs are jointly significant at the 1 percent level. </p>

        <p>Over the last quarter century, trade flows of goods and services have increased rapidly (Figure 4.1.1). The value of world trade has more than quintupled, from $8.7 trillion in 1990, to more than $46 trillion in 2014. The relative importance of trade has increased too, from 39 percent of world GDP in 1990, to 60 percent in 2014. That said, global trade growth has slowed to about 4 percent per year since the crisis from about 7 percent, on average, during 1990-07. This slowdown in world trade reflects weak global investment growth, maturing global supply chains, and slowing momentum in trade liberalization (World Bank 2015). </p>
        <p>On October 4, 2015, 12 Pacific Rim countries concluded negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest, most diverse and potentially most comprehensive regional trade agreement yet. The 12 member countries are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, United States, and Vietnam. While a detailed assessment will take time, this analysis and the assumptions used in its modelling exercise are based on a preliminary assessment of the agreement published in early November 2015. </p>
        <p>The TPP is one of several Mega-Regional Trade Agreements (MRTAs) that have emerged since the mid-1990s. As a deep and comprehensive newgeneration trade agreement, the TPP covers traditional barriers to trade in goods and services (e.g. tariffs, restrictions on the movement of professionals), investment activities, and other trade-related areas. Such areas include formal restrictions on some trade and investment activities, burdensome and inconsistent regulations, varying treatment of intellectual property, differing labor and environmental standards, issues specific to small and medium-size enterprises, and new challenges arising from rapidly growing digital technologies. China, the largest trading partner for most member countries of the agreement, is not included, nor is the Republic of Korea. The TPP, however, is designed as a living agreement to allow for membership expansion as well as broadening of coverage. </p>
        <p>This analysis aims to address the following questions: </p>
        <p> How do new-generation trade agreements (such as the TPP) differ from traditional free trade agreements (FTAs)? </p>
        <p> What are the main features of the TransPacific Partnership? </p>
        <p> What are the potential macroeconomic implications of the TPP? </p>
        <p>On October 4, 2015, 12 Paci c Rim countries concluded negotiations on the Trans-Paci c Partnership. If rati ed by all, the agreement could raise GDP in member countries by an average of 1.1 percent by 2030. It could also increase member countries trade by 11 percent by 2030, and represent a boost to regional trade growth, which had slowed to about 5 percent, on average, during 2010-14 from about 10 percent during 1990-07. To the extent that the bene ts of reforms have positive spillovers for the rest of the world, the detrimental effects of the agreement due to trade diversion and preference erosion on non-members, would be limited. The global signi cance of the agreement depends on whether it gains broader international traction. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pff4" class="" data-page-no="f4">
        <p>Rule-making in the world trading system has shifted from global to bilateral, regional, and sectoral agreements. The Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which culminated in the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994, produced a comprehensive agreement to reduce tariffs on manufactured goods. It also expanded into areas such as agriculture, trade in services, and intellectual property. However, complex trade policy issues, including regulatory barriers, modern services trade and cross-border investment (covered in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS) and the knowledge economy (key aspects covered under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) have been challenging to address at a multilateral level. Hence, cooperation on these issues has recently taken place through bilateral and/or regional agreements. While there were only a few of these before 2000, their number ballooned to 266 by 2014 (Figure 4.1.2). </p>
        <p>At the same time, the concept of deep and comprehensive FTAs has taken hold. These FTAs offer expanded market access, even for products that have previously aroused domestic sensitivities. Provisions can go well beyond WTO standards. Specific measures include the following: </p>
        <p> a negative-list approach for liberalizing trade in services, which covers all sectors except those explicitly listed (as opposed to the positive list of sectors under GATS); </p>
        <p> new rules for internet and digital commerce; across-the-board national treatment for foreign investors, both pre- and post establishment; </p>
        <p> streamlined regulations through standardized principles; </p>
        <p> enhanced intellectual property protection, with more comprehensive rules and greater enforcement obligations than in the TRIPS agreement; </p>
        <p> government procurement commitments </p>
        <p>(covered under the plurilateral Government Procurement Agreement in the WTO); </p>
        <p> competitive neutrality for state-owned enterprises; </p>
        <p> labor and environment codes; and </p>
        <p> improved dispute resolution for many issues covered in the agreement. </p>
        <p>Regional and mega-regional trade agreements </p>
        <p>In the 1990s, before the surge in bilateral and smaller regional agreements of the 2000s, two large Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) emerged: the European Union (EU) Single Market (established 1993) and the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States (NAFTA, established 1994). These agreements had evolved from two earlier agreements the European Economic Community, established in 1957 with six member countries, and the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement in 1987. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pff5" class="" data-page-no="f5">
        <p>Several other RTAs were established in the 1990s. Mercosur: Established in 1991, the agreement has six member states in Latin America, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela. </p>
        <p> South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA): Originally signed in 1993, the agreement deepened into the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) in 2004 and now covers eight South Asian countries, including India and Pakistan. </p>
        <p> Association of South East Asian Nations Free Trade Area (ASEAN): Signed in 1992, the agreement now includes ten East Asian countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. </p>
        <p>By 2015, the number of RTAs reached 274. The EU Single Market now covering 28 members and NAFTA are by far the largest RTAs in terms of GDP and trade. Together, their member countries account for 50 percent of global GDP and 37 percent of global trade (more than two times as much as the members of the smaller three RTAs combined). The EU Single Market and NAFTA are also the agreements with the largest intra-regional trade. Intra-EU trade accounts for 60 percent of total member trade, while intraNAFTA trade accounts for 41 percent of total member trade. This compares with less than 20 percent among members of the other three RTAs (Figure 4.1.2). </p>
        <p>Mega-regional trade agreements (MRTAs), as defined here, are regional agreements that have systemic, global impact. In other words, they are sufficiently large and ambitious to influence trade rules and trade flows beyond their areas of application. </p>
        <p>Earlier RTAs began as initiatives to reduce tariffs. Over time they grew to reduce non-tariff barriers. More recent regional negotiations have, from the outset, focused on more ambitious, deep, and comprehensive agreements. In addition to the TPP, major new negotiations include the Regional </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pff6" class="" data-page-no="f6">
        <p>Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) among 16 Asian economies, and the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States. An even larger Free Trade Area of the AsiaPacific (FTAAP) among 21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies is also in early stages of discussion. There is substantial overlap in membership of these groups (Figure 4.1.3). </p>
        <p>Benefits offered and challenges posed by RTAs </p>
        <p>The rise of regional agreements has rekindled debate on whether they support or impede global efficiency and activity in member and nonmember countries (WTO 2011; Freund and </p>
        <p>Ornelas 2010; World Bank 2005, Maggi 2014). Benefits for members. RTAs open markets between partners, leading to a more efficient division of labor, technology spillovers and related productivity growth ( trade creation ; Hoekman and Javorcik 2006, Blyde 2004). A growing literature suggests that trade agreements foster domestic reforms in developing countries (Baccini and Urpelainen, 2014a,b). For example, a range of regulatory reforms have followed EU enlargement (Schönfelder and Wagner 2015; Staehr 2011; Mattli and Plümper 2004; Milner and Kubota 2005). RTAs are also often a step toward larger agreements through the process of competitive liberalization (Baldwin and Jaimovich 2010). For example, the European integration project has expanded from six to 28 members so far. NAFTA grew out of an agreement between Canada and the United States, and while it did not itself expand further, it did spawn a network of agreements between its members and third partners. The AsiaPacific integration process appears to be following this path. </p>
        <p>Studies of the internal political economy of trading blocs point to other positive impacts of RTAs. The domino theory of regionalism argues that as a bloc grows, potential partners likely benefit more from joining, and therefore offer better deals to secure admission (Baldwin 1993). This tilts the political calculus within blocs toward admitting new members (McCulloch and Petri 1997). Blocs that gain critical mass for example, the European Union will therefore likely attract a growing membership. Outside the bloc, the bloc s policies could become an external anchor for institutional reforms in potential future member countries (IMF 2003). In addition, internal political constituencies change as blocs grow. </p>
        <p>Drawbacks for members and non-members. </p>
        <p>While RTAs may significantly benefit members, they can set back economic activity for nonmembers (Baldwin and Wyplosz, 2006; Krueger 1999). The competitiveness gains developed in these new blocs could potentially divert trade away from more efficient non-member exporters towards less efficient member ones (Viner 1950; Balassa 1967; Baldwin 2006), a phenomenon called the trade diversion effect. In addition, RTAs can result in the erosion in the value of preferences given to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) under existing duty-free, quota-free, preferential schemes, such as the Everything but Arms Initiative of the European Union and the African Growth and Opportunities Act of the U.S. This phenomenon (which applies to both regional and multilateral agreements) is sometimes called the preference erosion effect. </p>
        <p>RTAs within natural trading blocs among countries that already trade intensively with each other tend to have modest diversion effects (Eicher et al. 2012). As a percentage of their total trade, trade among the prospective member states of TPP, FTAAP, and RCEP (35-60 percent) already exceeds that within NAFTA (Figure 4.1.2). </p>
        <p>The TPP will expand mutual market access among member countries by lowering tariffs and easing the restrictiveness of non-tariff measures. Nontariff measures (NTMs) cover a wide range of measures that can be obstacles to trade, including import licensing requirements, rules for customs valuations, discriminatory standards, pre-shipment </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pff7" class="" data-page-no="f7">
        <p>only moderately restrictive NTMs (from zero to 10 percent) and a lower incidence of highly restrictive NTMs (greater than 100 percent) than other countries. Within the TPP group, NTMs are more restrictive in Asia than in North America and Latin America. Studies have noted that more restrictive NTMs have partially offset lower tariffs in advanced economies (Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga 2008). That said, assessing NTMs and their impact is particularly fraught with uncertainty since data on the existence of restrictive NTMs are highly uneven. Unlike tariffs, data on the intensity of NTMs is typically only inferred from bilateral trade flows. inspections, rules of origin to qualify for lower tariffs, investment measures (e.g. local content requirements), and local sourcing for government procurement. In addition, the TPP will facilitate supply chain integration by encouraging greater regional coherence in standards and regulations. Tariff and non-tariff measures </p>
        <p>Although both tariffs and restrictions caused by non-tariff measures between many TPP members are already low by historical and international comparison, the currently negotiated TPP, would over time eliminate nearly all of tariffs among its members, including very high ones such as the 350 percent tariff on US tobacco imports (Oliver 2015). Also, it would lower trade barriers associated with sizeable non-tariff measures in many member countries (Figure 4.1.4). </p>
        <p>Partly due to the general decline in worldwide tariffs, but also because of the proliferation of free trade agreements among TPP countries, average intra-TPP tariffs have more than halved since 1996, to 2.7 percent in 2014 from 5.6 percent in 1996. Much of TPP trade is already covered by trade agreements, including NAFTA; the ASEAN Free Trade Area; the free trade agreement between ASEAN, Australia, and New Zealand; the free trade agreement between ASEAN and Japan; and the P4 Agreement. 1 </p>
        <p>These averages, however, hide some high tariff barriers on individual goods. Product lines with average tariffs exceeding 15 percent sometimes dubbed international peaks often protect key domestic interests or industries (UNCTAD, 2000). In the United States and Canada, peaks comprise 3-5 percent of tariff lines. Some advanced countries still apply very high tariff rates on imports of certain items. Peru and Chile, in contrast, have zero peak tariffs. </p>
        <p>Restrictions caused by NTMs, measured as advalorem equivalents, appear to be less prevalent among TPP member countries than elsewhere. TPP member countries have a higher incidence of </p>

      <div id="pff8" class="" data-page-no="f8">
        <p>and environmental sustainability are politically contentious. What some interpret as civil rights and sustainability concerns are seen by others as hidden protectionism and restrictions on competition (Lukauskas et al. 2013). The TPP seeks to incorporate </p>
        <p>International Labor Organization (ILO) obligations, require domestic laws to be consistent with international standards, and provides for enforcement. Environmental standards introduced in the agreement address illegal wildlife trafficking, logging and fishing. They also include provisions on conservation, biodiversity, protecting the ozone layer and environmental goods and services. </p>
        <p> Intellectual property rights. The TPP goes somewhat beyond the WTO s TRIPS agreement. It requires penalties for the unlawful commercial exploitation of copyrighted work, and prescribes measures to reduce the illegal online distribution of copyrighted material and strengthen copyright terms.4 Some of the IP-related TPP provisions are highly controversial, including those for biologics and trademarks.5 Proponents argue that strong rules and enforcement are necessary in order to support investments in innovation, whereas critics maintain that current levels of IP protection already stifle innovation and generate monopoly rents.6 There is also a concern that greater IP protection will raise the cost of necessary medicines (Hersh and Stiglitz 2015; Stiglitz 2008; Gosselin 2015). </p>
        <p>Development of production and supply chains </p>
        <p>In addition to promoting comprehensive market access by reducing tariffs and the restrictiveness of NTMs, the TPP seeks to facilitate the development of supply chains among its members. Supply chain integration has deepened rapidly since 1995, raising the share of foreign value added in TPP member countries exports. TPP member countries share of foreign value added in exports ranges from 15 percent in advanced countries such as the United States, Australia, and Japan, to 40 percent in Singapore and Malaysia (Figure 4.1.4). The upper end of this range is high by international comparison, and broadly in line with foreign content shares in Eastern Europe, which is deeply integrated into Western European supply chains (OECD 2015).2 The expertise of advanced country firms at either the marketing end of the chain, or in providing crucial production technologies at the upstream end of the chain could contribute to the development of more complex value chains (Humphrey and Schmitz 2002; Kowalski et al. 2015). Conversely, supply chains also create interdependencies that can accelerate the transmission of shocks. </p>
        <p>Supply chains involve the close coordination of production decisions among different locations. They depend on rapid and reliable ways for shipping goods, making investments, and transferring information. Attracting supply chains to an economy requires good physical connectivity through ports, roads and telecommunications along with policies that facilitate trade in intermediate products and services, as well as foreign investment. Research suggests that liberal service sector rules are especially important, since high-quality logistics, transportation, financial and consulting services help to support supply chain connections (World Economic Forum, 2012). </p>
        <p>The TPP also includes social and environmental provisions that may impact trade and production chains:3 </p>

        <p>The estimations are based on a computable general equilibrium model as originally described in Zhai (2008). Annex 4.1.1 provides details of the analytical approach. The model is particularly well suited to analyzing trade policies and trade links because it allows the emergence of trade in products which were not previously traded between pairs of countries. While the model has some dynamic features (through savings and investment), it lacks positive dynamic feedback loops in member countries such as the accumulation of knowledge and the absorption of foreign technology through TPP-facilitated FDI. As a result, the benefits derived here could underestimate the eventual impact on member countries. Conversely, TPP-triggered productivity increases in member countries could undermine the competitiveness of non-member countries and exacerbate the detrimental effects on non-members. </p>
        <p>The results rest on planned tariff cuts in accordance with the provisions of TPP and on several key assumptions about the theoretically desirable and politically feasible non-tariff barrier cuts, dubbed actionable, and the actual cuts implemented in the TPP. The macroeconomic implications of the TPP are evaluated relative to a baseline scenario that includes pre-existing trade agreements among member countries (e.g. </p>
        <p>NAFTA, AFTA, the ASEAN-Australia-New </p>
        <p>Zealand FTA, the ASEAN-Japan FTA and the P4 </p>
        <p>Agreement). </p>
        <p>Three assumptions are of particular importance to the results: the restrictiveness of new rules of origin, cuts in barriers to services, and spillovers from regulatory harmonization.8 </p>
        <p> Cumulative rules of origin could encourage regional production networks but may require </p>
        <p>Although not explicitly modelled in this study, the harmonization of labor and environmental standards within the TPP could have important implications for participating developing countries, such as Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, and Vietnam. While such harmonization, which goes beyond product standards to encompass production process standards, has social and environmental benefits, it may also affect competitiveness of firms in countries that currently do not meet such standards. Traderelated product standards typically apply only to products destined for specific destinations, and a firm can choose whether to meet them. However, labor and environmental standards apply across the board to all production, including that destined for consumption at home and in nonTPP countries, and compliance is mandatory (and subject to dispute settlement).7 </p>
        <p>Some of these broader provisions, including labor, environmental, pharmaceutical and state-owned enterprise regulation, may require deep reforms and a difficult adjustment process in member countries. They are not modelled in the approach taken here, but could affect aggregate gains if fully implemented. For example, state-owned enterprise reform could generate significant productivity gains; tightened labor and environmental regulation could reduce competitiveness and GDP gains but achieve other regulatory objectives (Box 4.1.1). Similarly, free trade agreements are often followed by tariff reductions for non-members, which are not modelled here (Estevadeordal, Freund and Ornelas 2008; Freund and Ornelas 2010). Policy changes in non-members could enhance the benefits of TPP to them (Ciuriak and Singh 2015). </p>

        <p>some producers to replace more inputs with higher-cost inputs from TPP members to qualify for low TPP tariffs. The rules of origin affect the share of exports that benefit from tariff preferences. These shares are assumed to rise from 30 percent to 69 percent over a decade in the case of apparel, but more quickly for other products. The model assumes that rules of origin lead to the replacement of 40 percent of imported inputs with higher-cost regionally originating ones, on average. </p>
        <p> Existing services barriers are estimated indirectly from bilateral trade flows (Fontagne, Guillin and Mitaritonna 2011). Only half of these estimated barriers are assumed to be actionable through policy changes, and only a part of those are assumed to be eliminated by the TPP. While this fraction will depend on actual implementation, a preliminary assessment of the TPP suggests that the provisions are broadly in line with those in the existing agreement between Korea and the United States (e.g. provisions pertaining to greater transparency and enforceable negative lists). Therefore, the fraction of actual reductions in actionable services barriers is assumed to be similar to that observed in the agreement between Korea and the United </p>
        <p>States. </p>
        <p> Non-discriminatory trade liberalization (positive spillovers) will be a byproduct of the TPP, to some extent, as common and more transparent regulatory approaches also facilitate trade of non-members with TPP members (Box 4.1.1). Many TPP provisions that are designed to reduce the restrictiveness of NTMs focus on increasing the transparency and predictability of regulations, and still others require policies (such as rules for government procurement or electronic commerce) that are not easily restricted to members. Provided these provisions are fully implemented in a non-discriminatory manner, they will benefit members and non-members alike. At an aggregate level, 20 percent of NTM liberalization adopted in the TPP is assumed to consist of such non-discriminatory provisions. Although the debate on the precise number is not yet settled, this is at the low end of assumptions used in other studies based on business surveys (European </p>
        <p>Commission 2013).9 </p>
        <p>Overall member country impact. The model simulations suggest that, by 2030, the TPP will raise member country GDP by 0.4-10 percent, and by 1.1 percent, on a GDP-weighted average basis (Figure 4.1.5). The benefits are likely to materialize slowly but should accelerate towards the end of the projection period. The slow start results from the gradual implementation of the agreement and the lag required for benefits to materialize utilization rises. The benefits of the TPP would mostly derive from reductions in nontariff-based measures and measures that benefit </p>

        <p>services.10 For TPP members, only 15 percent of the GDP increase would be due to tariff cuts, whereas cuts in NTMs, in goods and services, would account for 53 percent and 31 percent of the total increase in GDP, respectively.11 </p>
        <p>Individual member country impact. The largest gains in GDP are expected in smaller, open member economies, such as Vietnam and </p>
        <p>Malaysia (10 percent and 8 percent, respectively).12 Both countries would benefit from lower tariffs and NTMs in large export markets and at home and from stronger positions in regional supply chains through deeper integration (World Bank 2015b). The impact on NAFTA members (all also members of TPP) would be small, on the order of 0.6 percent of GDP, because trade represents a modest share of GDP and because existing barriers to their trade (which is already mostly among them) are already low for the most traded commodities. </p>
        <p>Non-member impacts. Since almost half of trade is among TPP member countries, trade diversion effects could be limited (Figure 4.1.4). Nondiscriminatory liberalization effects (positive spillovers) account for 21 percent of the gains of members and 42 percent of estimated global gains, reflecting improved regulatory processes and the streamlining and harmonization of NTMs and investment barriers among TPP members. As a result, aggregate GDP losses to non-members could be of limited size (0.1 percent by 2030). Only in Korea, Thailand and some other Asian countries, the estimated GDP losses would exceed 0.3 percent of GDP since they would lose competitiveness in TPP members, which are currently among their most important export markets (Figure 4.1.6).13 While the adverse effects of TPP on Korea could be attributed mostly to preference erosion (due to its existing FTA with the United States), losses for Thailand and other Asian countries could be mainly due to trade diversion. This supports similar concerns raised for Asian LDCs not individually considered here, such as Bangladesh, Laos, Cambodia and Nepal (Lehmann 2015). These countries with strong comparative advantage in sectors such as apparel, textiles and footwear could face greater competition by Vietnam in TPP markets. For Russia, positive spillovers could slightly outweigh trade diversion effects. While aggregate output effects among nonmembers would likely be limited, the TPP could </p>

        <p>Sectoral shifts within TPP area. Although the TPP is unlikely to affect overall employment in the long run, it may accelerate structural shifts between industries based on comparative advantage and scale economies.14 In advanced economies, these mechanisms favor traded services, advanced manufacturing, and, for some resource-rich countries, primary products and investments. In developing countries, they benefit manufacturing, especially in unskilled laborintensive industries, and some primary production. As a result, participating advanced economy members are likely to experience a slight increase in skill premia while others benefit from a higher increase in the wages of unskilled workers (Figure 4.1.7). In the United States, for example, changes in real wages are expected to be small as unskilled and skilled wages increase by 0.4 and 0.6 percent, respectively, by 2030. In contrast, in Vietnam, TPP could increase the real wages of unskilled workers by more than 14 percent by 2030, as production intensive in unskilled labor (e.g. textiles) shifts to Vietnam. </p>
        <p>Comparison with other studies. Results reported here are broadly consistent with those of other studies, although estimating the impact of deep and comprehensive trade agreements is still very much a work in progress. The few studies that assess the economic impact of TPP find overall impacts for members on the order of 0.8-1.8 percent of GDP. This would be similar to those estimated for existing RTAs: in the long run (1520 years), NAFTA has been estimated to have raised member country GDP by 1-2 percent, and the European Single Market has been estimated to have lifted member country GDP by 2-3 percent (Figure 4.1.8).15 induce significant sectoral shifts.

        <p>countries see the liberalization required by the TPP as a driver for difficult policy changes. However, implementation of MRTAs, including the TPP, requires institutional capacity not available to some developing countries (Michalopoulos 1999; Hoekman et al. 2003). As the TPP is implemented over time, emphasis on the following issues would be important to mitigate unfavorable effects on developing countries: </p>
        <p> Capacity building. Capacity building and technical assistance for developing country members are an important building block of the TPP. </p>
        <p> Liberal rules of origin. TPP members and nonmembers will benefit if rules of origin mandating higher-cost inputs from TPP members are implemented in a permissive rather than restrictive manner. </p>
        <p> Liberalize labor- and resource-intensive industries. Low- and middle-income economies often have a comparative advantage in labor- and natural-resource intensive industries. By cutting tariffs for labor-intensive garments, the TPP thus benefits countries like Vietnam. </p>
        <p> Multilateral framework. Bringing MRTAs into a global framework would broaden the gains to a wider set of countries and reduce detrimental diversion effects for non-members. </p>
        <p>Implementation of the living agreement clause that keeps TPP membership open is particularly important. </p>
        <p>Against the background of slowing trade growth, rising non-tariff impediments to trade, and insufficient progress in global negotiations, the TPP represents an important milestone. The TPP stands out among FTAs for its size, diversity and rulemaking. Its ultimate implications, however, remain unclear. Much will depend on whether the TPP is quickly adopted and effectively implemented, and whether it triggers productive reforms in developing and developed countries. Broader systemic effects, in turn, will require expanding such reforms to global trade, whether through TPP enlargement, competitive effects on other trade agreements, or new global rules. This analysis discussed the features of newgeneration free-trade agreements and TPP, specifically, and traced out potential macroeconomic implications for member and non-member countries. As a new-generation, deep and comprehensive trade agreement, TPP addresses a wide range of complex trade policy issues that go beyond the scope of traditional trade agreements. The agreement will reduce tariffs and restrictiveness of non-tariff measures as well as harmonize a range of regulations to encourage the integration of supply chains and cross-border investment. </p>
        <p>TPP could be an important complement to other policies to lift medium-term growth: </p>
        <p> By shifting resources towards the most productive firms and sectors and expanding export markets, TPP has the potential to lift overall GDP of member countries by 1.1 percent by 2030. The impact could be considerably more in countries facing currently elevated barriers to trade (as much as 10 percent in Vietnam and 8 percent in Malaysia). In countries that export laborintensive products, incomes of low-income and low-skilled households could expand strongly. </p>
        <p> To the extent that the TPP produces positive spillover benefits for other countries, detrimental effects on non-member countries may be limited. Such positive spillovers could arise from harmonized regulatory regimes in TPP export markets. </p>
        <p> TPP could also lift member countries trade by 11 percent by 2030. This would be an important counterweight to the trade slowdown underway since 2011. At current 2011-14 trends, member countries trade would fall 25 percent below pre-crisis trend by 2030. </p>

        <p>productivity increases from the accumulation of knowledge and other endogenous growth effects, TPP-induced in ows of foreign technology and capital, and follow-up trade liberalization that may result from an agreement. Introducing such effects can dramatically change the results, as demonstrated by experiments reported in Todo (2013). </p>
        <p>Retrospective studies have shown that estimates based on conventional CGE models have underpredicted actual increases in trade (Kehoe, 2005). The likely reason is that traditional models projected trade increases only for products already exported (the intensive margin of trade), but had no mechanisms for anticipating new trading activities (the extensive margin of trade) (see Kehoe 2005, Zhai 2008, Hammouda and </p>
        <p>Osakewe 2008, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare 2013). This con rms the need for modeling the extensive margin of trade in assessing trade agreements as implemented in this study. In addition, several previous CGE applications were based on comparative static models with constant returns to scale, not incorporating the potential of FTAs for stimulating investment, capital stock growth, and productivity gains (Nielsen 2003, Hammouda and Osakewe 2008, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare 2013, Kose, Meredith and Towe 2005, Kouparitsas 1998). The present study allows for the dynamic accumulation of capital stock via investment and increases in productivity following entry and exit of rms in increasing returns to scale sectors. It does not however capture the dynamic growth effects via technological spillovers and learning by doing (Arrow 1962). </p>
        <p>Compared to Petri et al. (2012), the modeling framework used here introduces numerous updates to the underlying data and modeling speci cations. First, the underlying database has been updated to 2011 (compared to 2007 in the previous study) to incorporate not only macroeconomic changes but also updated tariff information. Baseline projections are updated (World Bank 2014; World Bank, forthcoming). The estimates also incorporate new trade balance Modelling strategy </p>
        <p>Results are based on a 19-sector, 29-region, dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. CGE models account simultaneously for interactions among rms, households, and governments in multiple product markets and across several countries and regions of the world economy. Firms are assumed to maximize pro ts and consumers to maximize utility. After transfers among rms, households, and governments, incomes are spent on goods, or are saved and invested, both at home and abroad. The model nds an equilibrium solution by calculating prices that equate supply to demand for each product and factor of production (labor, capital, and land) in every region. The effects of FTAs are simulated by introducing changes in tariffs and other parameters, nding a new equilibrium, and comparing new prices, output, trade, income, and demand to pre-change levels. </p>
        <p>Several innovative features of the model are based on a speci cation as in Zhai (2008). This relies on the theoretical work of Melitz (2003) and others that recognizes heterogeneity in rms productivity levels, even within narrowly de ned sectors. The model assumes that exports in any given sector involve special xed costs, which only the most productive rms in the sector can cover. In this setting, FTAs affect not only inter-sectoral specialization, but also the range of products traded, and the distribution of rms within industries. Liberalization causes more varieties to be exported and imported, the expansion of the most productive rms, and the contraction of the least productive rms. This speci cation predicts more trade and greater bene ts than conventional approaches based on inter-sectoral specialization effects alone. </p>
        <p>The model is dynamic in the sense that simulations track changes in the volume of savings, which affects capital accumulation over time. However, the model does not include other dynamic factors proposed in the literature, such as </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf103" class="" data-page-no="103">
        <p>early stages of the agreement. For large tariffs cuts, for which the preference margin changes by more than 5 percentage points, the effect of tariffs cuts is reduced by only 10 percent (rather than 31 percent) in the long run. </p>
        <p> Rules of origin. To qualify for preferential intra-TPP tariffs, TPP member countries need to comply with sector-speci c rules of origin, which require a minimum share of inputs from inside the TPP.1 On the surface, rules of origin are particularly stringent for garments and apparel ( yarn forward ); however, a number of exceptions soften the impact. Rules of origin in automotives, in contrast, appear less restrictive than in the agreement between the United States and Korea (45 percent within-TPP content compared with 55 percent in the Korea-U.S. agreement). Again, the impact is mitigated by a revised de nition of domestic and foreign content. As a result of rules of origin, where the tariff reduction is high, some inputs may now be sourced from within the TPP membership, replacing lower cost inputs used earlier. The fraction of inputs thus replaced is estimated to depend on the tariff preference margin and the economic size (GDP) of the membership of the agreement, since larger agreements are more likely to include more e cient input suppliers (Petri and Plummer forthcoming). Speci cally, for 40 percent of inputs, costs are assumed to rise by 10 percent of the tariff reductions offered by the agreement. </p>
        <p>Actionable non-tariff measures. NTMs for goods and services sectors are constructed from the estimates of Kee, Nicita, and Olarreaga (2009), updated to 2012 for goods, and from estimates by Fontagne, Guillin, and Mitaritonna (2011), for services. Three-quarters of these measured barriers which include regulations that increase consumer welfare are assumed to be impediments to trade and subject to reduction projections (IMF 2015). Second, based on the latest news about the TPP, the published TPP agreement, tariffs and the scoring of NTM provisions have been updated. Finally, the updated results include, as explained below, revised non-tariff barriers and limited nondiscriminatory liberalization effects (positive spillovers). </p>
        <p>Assumptions </p>
        <p>The results rest on a number of key assumptions, which are elaborated in more depth below. Tariff and non-tariff cuts are benchmarked against existing trade agreements. Since cross-country data is scarce, assumptions about utilization of preferential tariffs are based on eclectic survey information. </p>
        <p>Tariff cuts. The results incorporate the full, published schedule of tariff cuts under the TPP agreement. These commit the eventual elimination of nearly all tariffs, including on major imports into the United States (such as textiles and apparel) and developing countries (such as motor vehicles). Sixty percent of these tariff cuts will enter into force immediately, but a few, like those on trucks imported by the United States, are very back-loaded. These potential tariff cuts are, however, de facto mitigated by (i) less than full utilization rate of preferential tariffs and (ii) additional costs to meet rules of origin requirements. </p>
        <p> Utilization rate of preferential tariffs. As demonstrated by prior bilateral agreements, preferential tariff rates are seldom fully utilized due to either restrictive rules of origin, the high cost of compliance compared to bene ts from preferential rates, or low initial tariffs. The exercise here assumes that less than full utilization of preferences will reduce the effective tariff cuts from TPP membership. A formula is constructed to estimate utilization rates based on the preferential tariff margin and the size of the TPP relative to other agreements for which some survey data is available (Petri et al. 2012). As a result, the effect of tariff cuts introduced by TPP are reduced by 31 percent in the long run, and by </p>

        <p>some modi cations based on analysis of the TPP text. This fraction is derived for 21 separate issues areas based on a score from 0-100, with a higher score indicating larger reductions in trade barriers by TPP compared with existing FTAs (Figure 4.1.1). The issues areas range widely from government procurement, dispute settlement, and environment to tariffs and customs procedures. Non-discriminatory liberalization (positive spillovers). As noted above, some of the bilateral reductions in the restrictiveness of NTMs and investment barriers that countries make under an agreement are assumed to reduce barriers also against countries not participating in the agreement. These include especially efforts to improve the transparency and predictability of regulations and mechanisms to bring together regulators to encourage streamlining of regulations. Estimates of this spillover ratio range from 20 to 65 percent in the literature (Francois et al. 2013, Kawasaki 2014); the exercise here uses the low end of this range, or 20 percent. Largest cuts.2 These assumptions yield the highest tariff cuts in sectors such as apparel, where on average intra-TPP trade weighted tariffs decline by 8.8 percentage points. With respect to reductions in the restrictiveness of NTMs, the largest are in goods such as apparel, textiles and processed food (cuts by 7.2, 5.0 and 5.4 percentage points, respectively), and construction and private services (cut by 8.0 and 8.5 percentage points, respectively). In contrast, reductions would be marginal in mining. On average, the liberalization of tariffs is assumed to be more front-loaded, and that of the restrictiveness of NTMs more backloaded. These reductions in the restrictiveness of NTMs are based on the assumption of the degree of implementation consistent with Korea-US FTA. In the event actual implementation is incomplete, the likely gains from TPP could be signi cantly diminished. through trade policy, with the rest representing quality-increasing regulations. Further, only threequarters of the remaining NTMs in the case of goods, and only one-half in the case of services, are assumed to be politically feasible in a trade agreement (i.e., actionable ). </p>
        <p>Actual NTM reductions. The rationales laid out above derive the theoretically desirable and politically feasible reductions in the restrictiveness of NTM. However, trade negotiations do not necessarily achieve full liberalization of actionable barriers. A preliminary assessment suggests that the provisions in TPP resemble those in the agreement between Korea and the United States. While the actual impact depends on the degree to which these are implemented, the assumption is that the fraction of actionable NTM reductions is </p>

        <p>The outlook for emerging and developing countries is clouded by various downside risks, including a deterioration in global nancial conditions, sudden reappraisal by market participants of lingering domestic vulnerabilities, and adverse spillovers from weaker growth (Chapter 1). Should one or more of these risks materialize, they could have signi cant effects on economic conditions in many emerging and developing countries. These effects may include large currency depreciations in some countries with exible exchange regimes, reserve losses in some countries aiming to preserve exchange rate pegs, and restrictions on capital mobility in some countries facing capital ight. More generally, how countries fare and how policymakers respond to the realization of these risks will depend on a wide range of factors, but two macroeconomic policy choices play fundamental roles: the exchange rate regime (ERR) and the stance towards capital ows (i.e., the use of capital ow measures, CFMs). </p>
        <p>A exible exchange rate regime can provide greater room for monetary policy to stabilize output uctuations in countries with open capital accounts, as well as encourage a more proper assessment of currency risk. However, it can sometimes be associated with volatility in currency markets, which can raise nancial stability risks in countries with signi cant currency mismatches on balance sheets. It can also restrict monetary policy options in countries where exchange rate uctuations have a rapid impact on in ation or where inter-sectoral factor mobility is limited (Ostry, Ghosh, and Chamon 2012). Conversely, a xed exchange rate regime can serve as a stabilizing nominal anchor in the presence of nancial volatility. It can also boost trade, which may offset weakness in external demand (Rose 2000; Rose and van Wincoop 2001; Frankel and Rose 2002; Klein and Shambaugh 2006). </p>
        <p>However, in the presence of high capital mobility, a xed regime may require the central bank to direct monetary policy towards the maintenance of the peg rather than towards the promotion of economic activity (Frankel, Schmukler, and Serven 2004; Shambaugh 2004; Obstfeld, </p>
        <p>Shambaugh, and Taylor 2010; Klein and </p>
        <p>Shambaugh 2015). </p>
        <p>A country s choice of capital ow measures can affect the performance of asset markets, the cost of capital, and technological progress embodied in foreign direct investment (Henry 2007). More broadly, capital account policies can affect the pace of economic growth (Kose, Prasad, Rogoff, and Wei 2009). Accordingly, there have been extensive discussions about the appropriate role of capital ow measures. In the wake of the global nancial crisis, a case has been made for the use of CFMs, recognizing that capital ows can affect the incidence of boom-and-bust cycles in nancial markets. The effectiveness of these policies, however, has been the subject of debate.1 </p>
        <p>In a context of rising risks, choices with respect to exchange rate regimes and capital account policies are of key importance for emerging and developing countries. This essay explores the empirical links between a country s choice of currency regimes and of capital ow measures. The results suggest that developing countries appear to be more likely to have capital ow restrictions if they also have xed exchange rates. This effect is particularly pronounced for lower-income countries, suggesting complex policy choices with respect to exchange rate regimes and capital ow measures. </p>

        <p>The joint choice of exchange rate regimes and capital account policies therefore has important implications for macroeconomic outcomes. While some studies have explored the choice of the ERR and others have examined the use of CFMs, there has been little empirical analysis on the links between ERR and CFM choices.2 This essay documents the association between the choices of exchange rate regime and capital account policies in emerging markets, frontier markets, and other middle- and low-income countries. While this analysis focuses on emerging and developing countries, it provides some context by including data on advanced high-income economies as well. Speci cally, the essay asks three questions: What does economic theory say about the choice of ERRs and CFMs? </p>

The third category comprises other middle-income countries that are neither emerging nor frontier markets (and therefore have little to no access to international capital markets) along with low-income countries. The choice of a country s exchange rate regime can be based on a variety of theoretical considerations, including the following:3 </p>
        <p> Optimal currency area factors. Policymakers in some countries may weigh the advantages of pegging such as more stable trade and investment ows, particularly vis-à-vis a large trading partner against the disadvantages of forgoing exchange rate exibility as a stabilizer for external shocks. </p>
        <p> Sources of macroeconomic shocks. A small open economy may choose to peg if it is often subject to highly volatile shocks to its asset markets or prices. In the face of such nominal shocks, a xed exchange rate could provide a nominal anchor that stabilizes prices and activity (provided that the shock is temporary). A country may also choose to peg if it faces similar economic shocks to those of the base country. In contrast, a oating exchange rate can provide greater stability if an economy is often facing real shocks that is, disturbances to factors that affect its aggregate demand or supply. </p>
        <p> Monetary policy independence. The choice of currency regime may re ect an emphasis on the importance of either monetary autonomy, when the central bank is not obliged to direct its efforts towards the maintenance of a pegged regime, or of importing the monetary policy credibility of the base country in order to better manage in ationary expectations. </p>
        <p>The decision of whether, and how, to control capital ows weighs the bene ts of a liberal regime with no capital controls against those of an environment in which the ow of capital is managed: </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf107" class="" data-page-no="107">
        <p> Bene ts of freely owing international capital. These include the scope for an e cient allocation of capital, risk diversi cation, and consumption smoothing. Countries with insu cient savings can draw on world savings to nance the expansion of their capital stock. The world capital market can also help countries diversify risk and, in so doing, undertake projects that would otherwise not be nanced. Also, borrowing during slowdowns and paying back during expansions can help the residents of a country avoid wide swings in their consumption. Free capital ows may also be welfare-enhancing, as capital controls can generate distortions in real and nancial activity if they are not properly designed. </p>
        <p> Potential downsides of open capital markets. Open capital markets could allow global nancial cycles to adversely affect an economy. In this way, a country could lose control over its macroeconomic outcomes. Capital in ows could contribute to an unsustainable asset price boom and exchange rate overvaluation. Capital out ows, and especially a sudden stop, could be a source of a currency collapse, nancial disruption, and a sharp decline in real activity.4 </p>
        <p>There may be links across the joint choice of ERRs and CFMs. The importance and extent of these links may depend upon other factors, such as nancial development, openness to trade, and sectoral diversi cation (and, therefore, the sensitivity of domestic activity to exchange rate movements). The nature of the interaction between ERR and CFM is shaped by a number of factors, including the following: </p>
        <p> The trilemma. Countries can choose only two of the following three objectives: open capital account, independent monetary policy, and exchange rate stability. Thus, countries with xed exchange rates would have to give up free capital mobility in order to have an independent monetary policy. In other words, they may choose to use CFMs to stabilize the exchange rate, allowing monetary policy to focus on domestic macroeconomic goals </p>
        <p>(Shambaugh 2004; Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor 2010; Klein and Shambaugh </p>
        <p>2015). </p>
        <p> The preservation of a pegged regime. Capital ows may also make the preservation of a xed exchange rate more di cult since, under certain circumstances, capital ight could cause a peg to break.5 This suggests another </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf108" class="" data-page-no="108">
        <p>link between ERR and CFM, especially for controls on out ows relative to in ows if there is a greater concern about a devaluation than a revaluation. Controls on in ows could also be important if they drive currency appreciation (with exible exchange rates) or an asset price boom (with pegged rates). </p>
        <p> The type of pegged regime. Some of these issues are conditional on the form of the peg. For example, if the regime is a credible hard peg (e.g., a currency union), monetary autonomy is fully surrendered, and the peg s preservation is generally not a concern. In this case, capital controls may not be as prevalent as in other types of xed exchange rate regimes. </p>
        <p>Combining two extensive databases on exchange rate regimes and capital ow measures, this analysis uses data on 93 countries over the period 1995 to 2013. Both the country list and the time period are determined by data availability. The set of emerging and developing countries is divided into three categories: 24 emerging market economies, 29 frontier market economies, and 13 other middle-income and low-income countries. For comparison purposes, a fourth category comprising 27 advanced high-income economies is included. (A listing of the countries in each of these four categories is provided in Annex Table 4.1.) </p>
        <p>Exchange rate regimes </p>
        <p>The exchange rate regime classi cation is based on the de facto regime classi cation from Shambaugh (2004) and updated in Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2010) to include a soft peg variable (see Annex 4.2 for details on the classi cation methodology). These studies use actual exchange rate movements to classify regimes into pegs, nonpegs, and soft pegs. Among emerging market economies, oating exchange rate regimes are more common than soft pegs or tightly pegged exchange rates (Figure 4.2.1). These observations span emerging market economies that have had oating regimes during all or almost all of the 1995-2013 period (e.g., Turkey, South Africa) and those that have had tight pegs during all the period (e.g., Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). </p>
        <p>The exchange rate regime choice of frontier market economies is the mirror image of emerging market economies, with the highest number of observations being pegs and the fewest number of observations being oats. In this group, relatively few frontier markets have had oating regimes for most of the period (e.g., Paraguay, Zambia), while several countries have had tight pegs for all 19 years of the period (e.g., Bahrain, Cote d Ivoire, Lebanon, Oman, Panama). Other middle- and low-income countries have an even distribution </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf109" class="" data-page-no="109">
        <p>across the three exchange rate regime categories, with a few countries exhibiting oating regimes for most of the period (e.g., Algeria, Uganda) and some countries with tight pegs for all 19 years (e.g., Burkina Faso, Swaziland, Togo). For comparison, advanced economies, excluding Euro Area countries, have a relatively even distribution of oats and soft pegs and a lower incidence of pegs. </p>
        <p>Capital flow measures </p>
        <p>This analysis uses the Fernández et al. (2015) de jure capital control data. These data are used to construct an aggregate capital control indicator as the average of nine categories for both in ows and out ows (see Annex 4.2 for details on the classi cation methodology). For each country and for each year, the average of in ow controls and out ow controls for the nine categories of assets is computed. This aggregate indicator takes a value between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no controls on any category of assets and 1 indicating controls on both in ows and out ows of all nine categories of assets. </p>
        <p>These data can be used to place countries in one of three categories with respect to their use of CFMs (as in Klein 2012). The rst category is Open, for countries that almost never use capital controls. The second category is Closed, for countries that have capital controls in the vast majority of asset categories and for the vast majority of years. The third category is Partially Open, for countries that make occasional use of capital controls. </p>
        <p>Among emerging and developing countries, the most common classi cation is Partially Open (Figure 4.2.2). These include 17 out of 24 emerging markets (including Arab Republic of Egypt, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey), 15 out of 29 frontier markets (including Argentina, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Kenya, República Bolivariana de Venezuela, and Vietnam), and 7 out of 13 other middle-income and low-income countries (including Algeria, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uganda). In comparison, advanced countries are far less likely to use capital controls than countries in the other groups, and none do so in a persistent and systematic way (that is, none are classi ed as Closed). </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf10a" class="" data-page-no="10a">
        <p>development across ERRs and CFMs </p>
        <p>Pegged exchange rate regimes appear to be associated with greater trade openness than exible regimes, in both the full sample as well as in the sample comprised of emerging and developing countries. That is, the frequency distributions of trade-to-GDP ratios for economies with mostly pegged currencies (red lines in Figure 4.2.3) lie to the right of those for more exible currencies (blue lines in Figure 4.2.3). In addition, countries that use capital controls from time to time appear to trade somewhat less than countries that have either no capital controls or those that have pervasive capital controls. That is, the frequency distributions of trade-to-GDP ratios for the Partially Open group (red lines in Figure 4.2.4) lie to the left of those for the other groups. </p>
        <p>Open countries appear more likely to be nancially developed (have larger nancial sectors as a share of GDP) than Partially Open and Closed countries. That is, for the full sample, the distribution for the Open group of credit-to-GDP ratios (blue line in the upper panel of Figure 4.2.5) is more skewed to the right than those for the Partially Open and Closed groups. That said, a large literature on nancial development and growth suggests that richer countries are more nancially developed (King and Levine 1992, Sahay et al. 2015). Since emerging and developing economies tend to have more capital controls than advanced economies, the greater nancial development for Open countries may largely re ect the role of advanced economies. Con ning the sample to emerging and developing economies, there is indeed no apparent evidence of higher levels of nancial development in Open countries that is, frequency distributions show no discernible difference in the skewness of the Open group (blue line in the lower panel of Figure 4.2.5) relative to the others. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf10b" class="" data-page-no="10b">
        <p>The discussion above suggests that the choice of ERR may predetermine the extent of CFMs. A multivariate regression model, focusing on the sample of emerging and developing countries, is used to estimate the partial correlation between capital controls and pegged exchange rates, while controlling GDP per capita, GDP, trade share, size of the nancial sector, and currency union membership (Column I of Annex Table 4.2). The regression estimate shows a positive, statistically signi cant partial correlation between the extent of capital controls and the propensity to peg (Figure 4.2.6).6 It also shows a statistically signi cant negative correlation between capital controls and income per capita, and a statistically signi cant positive correlation between capital controls and both income and trade. </p>
        <p>The negative relationship between income per capita and the CFM variable is further explored by estimating a regression that allows the association of the pegged exchange rate on capital controls to vary with the level of income per capita. This is done by including an interaction term between the GDP per capita variable and the peg variable (Column II of Annex Table 4.2). These results also show the effects for the average levels of income per capita for each of the three categories of emerging and developing countries (bottom of Column II). For comparison, the fourth category of advanced economies is also included. This effect is statistically signi cant for the average income per capita of frontier markets and other middle- and low-income countries, but not for emerging market economies.7 It is also insigni cant for advanced economies, providing additional evidence that the effect of peg regimes on CFMs are contingent on income per capita.8 </p>
        <p>Figure 4.2.7 presents the effect of pegged regimes on capital controls as a function of income per capita. The thick solid black line shows the estimated value of the effect of peg regimes on capital controls for each level of income per capita, and the dashed red lines show the 95 percent con dence interval of this estimate. The vertical </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf10c" class="" data-page-no="10c">
        <p>line shows the level of per capita income after which this effect is no longer statistically signi cant. The points on the solid line show the average values of income per capita for the four country categories. The solid line is downward sloping, suggesting that the association between the capital control and peg indices decreases with an increase in income per capita. Moreover, in emerging market economies (as well as in advanced economies), there appears to be no statistically signi cant association between the choice of exchange rate regime and the choice of capital account policies. </p>
        <p>As emerging and developing countries prepare against various risks besetting the global economy, they need to consider policy responses to adjust to external shocks. Among these policy responses, some countries might rely on exchange rate exibility as a buffer, some might aim to minimize currency uctuations, and some might consider capital ow measures as they seek to keep some degree of monetary policy control. </p>
        <p>Policies concerning the choice of the exchange rate regime and the use of capital ow measures are central to macroeconomic management, especially in emerging and developing countries. An empirical exploration using a comprehensive database of exchange rate regimes and capital ow measures suggests that capital controls are more likely to be present when a country has a xed exchange rate. Moreover, this correlation is mainly present in countries at lower levels of income per capita. These ndings raise a number of policyrelated issues: </p>
        <p> At lower levels of economic and nancial development proxied by lower levels of income per capita policymakers may be constrained to jointly and tightly control both the exchange rate and the capital account. Accordingly, policy choices in developing countries should not be seen in isolation, and policy recommendations need to recognize that policy choices are not independent from each other. </p>
        <p> Higher levels of development may allow greater discretion to implement some variant of these two policies. Alternatively, countries that are more nancially developed might nd it harder to control the capital account regardless of currency regime given their high level of international nancial integration. In this context, attempts to control capital ows would be more likely to fail due to circumventions by market participants. </p>
        <p> In principle, emerging and developing countries that choose to control both the exchange rate and the capital account may still exercise monetary policy autonomy to stabilize economic conditions (Cordella and Gupta 2015). This is only possible, however, if they have the necessary monetary policy space which has generally been narrowing recently, amid in ation and foreign reserve pressures (Chapter 1). </p>
        <p> These choices could also re ect preferences among policymakers. Those who have a preference for intervening in the market may see both CFM and a xed exchange rate as desirable, whereas those who prefer to let market forces reign may prefer a oating exchange rate and unfettered capital ows. A preference for greater intervention may be more prevalent at lower levels of development, perhaps re ecting actual or perceived constraints faced by policymakers at such levels. </p>
        <p> Finally, it remains to be established empirically whether the joint choice to control both the exchange rate and the capital account implies welfare gains or losses for example, in terms of output growth or nancial stability for lower income countries. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="pf10d" class="" data-page-no="10d">
        <p>261 country-year observations with a pegged exchange rate are countries in the Euro Area. After excluding Euro Area members, there is a relatively even distribution of observations among oats (118) and soft pegs (134), and a lower incidence of pegs (79). </p>
        <p>Note the persistence of these choices across countries. There is a considerable amount of ipping behavior by countries (Klein and Shambaugh 2008). Exchange rate pegs frequently break, but they also frequently re-form, such that some countries ip back and forth from a peg to a oat and back. That said, in shorter samples such as this 19-year period it is more common to nd a country with just one regime (especially if limiting the categorization to the binary peg or non-peg). </p>
        <p>In this sample of 93 countries, 30 countries never peg and 16 always do, leaving the remaining 37 countries having some pegged years and some non-peg years. Adding the 9 countries that peg in only 1 or 2 years and 6 countries that oat in only 1 or 2 years, one is left with 39 countries that nearly always oat and 22 that nearly always peg. The remaining 32 countries ip between oating and pegging, with 8 of these transitioning from one ERR to another only once, but the 14 ipping two or three times, and 10 ipping four or more times. </p>
        <p>CFM Data </p>
        <p>The capital ow measures classi cation is based on Fernández, Klein, Schindler, Rebucci, and Uribe (2015). This classi cation scheme is based on controls and requirements reported in the IMF s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). This data set includes separate indicators for in ows and out ows for ten categories of assets. For this essay, as explained in the text, an aggregate indicator is constructed as the average of nine of these categories for both in ows and out ows, omitting controls on direct investment because these ERR Data </p>
        <p>The exchange regime classi cation is based on Shambaugh (2004) and updated in Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2010). It uses actual exchange rate movements to see if a country stays within a +/- 2 percent band over the course of a year against a relevant base currency. If so, the country is classi ed as having a peg. Otherwise, it is classi ed as a non-peg. To insure the stability is deliberate and not a random lack of volatility, countries that peg for only one year are not coded as pegs. To handle one-off realignments, a country that has zero volatility in 11 out of 12 months is also considered a peg (again, as long as it is also pegged the year before or after). Soft pegs are identi ed as countries that do not maintain the strict boundary, but stay within 5 percent bands or stay within moving 2 percent bands in every month (that is, the change in any given month is never greater than 2 percent). Given the interest in the correlation of ERR and CFM, it is preferable to use a classi cation that uses only o cial market exchange rate behavior, not interest rates or black market exchange rates whose behavior may be a function of capital controls. </p>
        <p>There are 1765 available observations with ERR data in the sample for 93 countries over 19 years. There are 707 pegs, 527 soft pegs, and 531 nonpegged country-year observations in the data set. observations of pegged exchange rates, 147 observations of soft pegs, and 200 observations of oats. observations, 163 soft peg observations, and 141 oat observations. group, there are 91 peg observations, 83 soft pegs observations, and 72 oats observations. </p>

        <p>control index (average value over sample period), in any one year 1 kc 0, with larger values representing more controls in place. The main independent variables is a logarithmic transformation of the above-mention pegged regime indicator ln((100×peg)+1), where peg is proportion of years country had a pegged exchange rate, 1 peg 0. The other controls are the logarithms of GDP per capita, GDP, trade share, and size of the nancial sector, as well as a currency union control dummy. (The regressions in Columns I and II use 64 rather than 66 observations because there are missing values for GDP variables for Argentina and Jamaica.) The plot shown in Figure 4.2.6 suggests that the results in Annex Table 4.2 are not driven by a small set of outliers. </p>
        <p>Figure 4.2.7 shows the effect of peg regimes on capital controls as a function of income per capita. The thick solid black line shows the estimated value of the effect of peg regimes on capital controls for each level of income per capita, and the dashed red lines show the 95 percent con dence interval of this estimate (again, all expressed in logarithms). The vertical line at 9.34 means that the partial correlation is signi cant at the 95 percent level of con dence only for countries with the logarithm of income per capita below 9.34. The four richest countries with a value of the logarithm of income per capita below this cutoff are Algeria, Costa Rica, South Africa, and Thailand. The solid line is downward sloping, suggesting that the association between the capital control and peg indices decreases with an increase in income per capita. </p>
        <p>A number of robustness tests using additional panel regressions were conducted and reported in the accompanying background paper (Arteta, Klein, and Shambaugh forthcoming). Those results support the central result above, and also justify the focus on using a cross-country sample rather than a panel consisting of country-year observations. controls often re ect non-economic concerns, such as national security. For each country and for each year, the average of in ow controls and out ow controls for the nine categories of assets is used. This aggregate indicator takes a value between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no controls on any category of assets and 1 indicating controls on both in ows and out ows of all nine categories of assets. almost never use capital controls. For this category, the average value of the capital control index over the sample period is less than 0.15, the maximum value in any one year is less than 0.25, and the standard deviation of the index across time is less than 0.10. have capital controls for almost all (or all) categories of assets for almost all (or all) years. For this category, the average value of capital controls across the sample period is greater than 0.70, the minimum value is greater than 0.60, and the standard deviation is less than 0.10. </p>
        <p> The Partially Open category is for countries that make occasional use of capital controls. Countries that are neither Open nor Closed are classi ed as Partially Open. </p>
        <p>In the data set of 93 countries, 30 are classi ed as Open, 13 as Closed, and 50 as Partially Open. In the emerging market group, 17 countries are classi ed as Partially Open, 5 as Closed, and only 2 as Open. In the frontier market group, 15 are classi ed as Partially Open, 10 as Open, and 4 as Closed. The other middle- and low-income group includes 7 Partially Open countries, 4 Closed countries and 2 Open countries.
